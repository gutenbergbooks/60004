<h2 id="THE_PREFACE_DEDICATORY" class="nobreak p2">THE PREFACE DEDICATORY.</h2>

<p class="center b2"><i>To the Youth of the British Isles.</i></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> collecting together, for your use and benefit, some
of the prudential maxims, and moral apothegms, of the
ancient sages, the Publishers of this volume have been
stimulated by an ardent desire to render this excellent
mode of instruction as agreeable as possible; and, at
the same time, to impress the precepts contained in the
Fables more forcibly on your minds, they have endeavoured
to make the embellishments worthy of your notice
and examination.</p>

<p>If the seeds of morality and patriotism be early
sown, they will spring up, and ripen to maturity, in
a confirmed love of truth, integrity and honour; and
without these for his guide, no man can do credit to
himself or his country. This consideration is of vital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
importance; for our comfort and happiness through
life, mainly depend upon a strict adherence to the rules
of morality and religion. The youth who is early tutored
in an invincible regard for his own character, will
soon perceive the duties imposed upon him by society,
and will have pleasure in fulfilling them, as much for
his own satisfaction as for the sake of his fellow men:
but when the latent powers of the mind are neglected,
or not directed into the paths of rectitude, by good precepts
and worthy examples, vice and folly enter the
opening, and lead their victim into evils and errors,
which render his life miserable, and sometimes hurry
him into an ignominious grave.</p>

<p>To delineate the characters and passions of men, under
the semblance of Lions, Tigers, Wolves, and Foxes,
is not so extravagant a fiction as it may at first sight
seem: for the innocent and inexperienced will find,
when they engage in the busy scenes of the world, that
they will have to deal with men of dispositions not unlike
those animals; and that their utmost vigilance will
be required to guard against their violence or machinations.</p>

<p>In attempting to form an estimate of the characters
of mankind, many gradations and shades will be found
between the two extremes of virtue and vice. The
philanthropist views with feelings of benevolence the
wavering balance, and adds those he finds on the confines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
to the number of the virtuous; while the misanthrope,
with gloomy malignity, endeavours to include
within the circle of vice, those who are standing upon
the ill-defined line of division, and thus swells the number
of the bad. Both observe with pain, that great
numbers exist, whose whole lives seem to be spent in
disfiguring the beautiful order which might otherwise
reign in society, regardless of the misery which their
wickedness scatters around them. They see men, who
suffer their bad passions and gross appetites to be the
sole rule of their conduct; and whether these shew
themselves in an inordinate ambition, a thirst after false
glory, or an insatiable avarice, their consequences are
pernicious, and diffuse evil, distress, and ruin among
mankind, in proportion to the extent to which their
baneful influence reaches. The misanthrope, in contemplating
the scene of mischief and disorder, is apt to
arraign the wisdom and justice of Providence for permitting
it to exist; but the philanthropist views it
with a more extended range of vision; and while he
laments the evil, he attributes the apparent want of
human feelings in the actors, to an early perversion of
intellect, or to a stifling of the reasoning power given
by the Great Creator to man for his guide, and without
which he is the worst animal in the creation, a
mere two-legged Tiger. Upon the childhood and
youth of such men, the great truth taught by the inspired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
and wisest writers of all ages, that “no life can
be pleasing to God which is not useful to man,” has
not been sufficiently impressed, or probably the energy
with which they pursue their wicked career might have
been led into a different course, and instead of the
scourges, they would have been the benefactors of
mankind.</p>

<p>When religion and morality are blended together
in the mind, they impart their blessings to all who seek
the aid of the one and obey the dictates of the other,
and their joint effects are seen and felt in the perpetual
cheerfulness they impart. They incite the innocent
whistle of the ploughman at his plough, of the cobler in
his stall, and the song of the milk-maid at her pail:
and it is a sign of their being perverted, when they
engender melancholy notions; for these are the offspring
of bigotry, fanaticism, and ignorance. The
service of the Omnipotent is not of this gloomy cast;
he has spread out the table of this beautiful world of
wonders, for the use of his creatures, and has placed
man at the head of it, that he might enjoy its bounties,
as well as prepare himself for the approaching change
to another, which inspiration has powerfully impressed
on his soul as the <em>unknowable</em> region of his next advance.
The materialist, in his dreary reveries, cannot
comprehend this, neither will he acknowledge that
his being placed here is equally as miraculous as that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
he should be placed in another world or worlds, progressively
to improve, to all eternity: but to harbour
doubts on this subject, is like disputing the wisdom,
the justice, and the mercy of the Author of our being,
who, according to the conceptions we form of his
goodness, as exhibited in the design, the grandeur, and
the immensity of creation, where every thing is systematic,
regular, and in order, would never decree that man
should be placed here instinctively to know his Maker—to
take a short peep at the stupendous, the amazing
whole—to view all these, and have powers of mind
given him only to know and repugnantly to feel, that
after a life mixed with turmoil, grief, and disease, he is
to be annihilated! In our conception of things, and to
the limited understanding which has been given us, all
this would appear to be labour in vain.</p>

<p>The volume of the creation speaks alike to all, and
cannot be defaced by man; but the ways of Providence
are beyond his comprehension. Omnipotence has not
been pleased to gratify his pride and vanity, nor to
consult his understanding, in the government of the
universe; but sufficient has been disclosed unto him to
point out the moral duties he owes to society, and the
religious worship due to his Maker, without groping
after what is utterly beyond his reach: for our feeble
reason is too weak to comprehend the divine essence;
and our thoughts, on their utmost stretch, roll back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
on darkness. We reason, but we err: for how can
we comprehend the immensity of endless space, of time
and eternity, a beginning or an end; or what conceptions
can we form of the Power which made the sun
and worlds without number? Truly, this is far too
much for a finite being, who does not know why he can
move one of his own fingers, or cease to do so when he
pleases! But all may know and fulfil their religious
obligations, by reverencing and adoring their Creator,
and walking humbly before him, and their moral duties,
by being in their several stations, good sons, brothers,
husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, neighbours,
and members of society.</p>

<p>Having, with humble diffidence, in this masquerade
of life, attempted to point out to youth the exterior of
the temple of virtue, and to lead them to its steps, the
Editor leaves them there, respectfully recommending
them to explore the whole interior, under the guidance
of men more eminent for their mental powers and attainments
in learning, philosophy, and piety. Of these,
an illustrious band have placed, at every avenue and
turning, their inestimable works, as directions to guide
us to usefulness and respectability here, and eternal
happiness hereafter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">From</span> time to time, in all ages, men inspired, or
gifted with a superior degree of intellectual power,
have appeared upon the stage of life, in order (by enlightening
others) to fulfil the designs of Omnipotence,
in uniting the world in a state of civilized society.</p>

<p>Patriarchs, or heads of families, at first directed or
governed those who were immediately dependent upon
them: these in time increased, and became <em>clans</em>; these
again, by their quarrels, and their wars, were induced
to elect chieftains or kings over a number of united
clans,—from which were formed the various nations
and kingdoms of the earth. In this early stage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
world, when men were ignorant and uncivilized, the
chase and war seem almost wholly to have occupied
their time and attention. Their kings ruled over them
with despotic sway, and the will of the prince was the
only law: and thus the barbarism of the subject and
the tyranny of the ruler went hand in hand together.
That over-swollen pride, which seems the natural accompaniment
of despotic power, blinds the understandings
of its possessors, and renders them wholly regardless
of the important trust reposed in them. The evils
arising out of their bad government, are felt, more or
less, by the whole people over whom they preside; and
pride and arrogance prevent the approach of sincerity
and truth. The sycophant and the slave then only
find admission, and all other men are kept at a distance.
While kings and governors were of this character,
the voice of truth could only reach their ears
through allegory and fable, which took their rise in
the infancy of learning, and seem to have been the
only safe mode of conveying admonition to tyrants.
This pleasing method of instilling instruction into the
mind, has been found by experience to be the shortest
and best way of accomplishing that end, among all
ranks and conditions of men.</p>

<p>The first Fable upon record, is that of Jotham and
the Trees, in the Bible; and the next, that of The
Poor Man and his Lamb, as related by Nathan to
King David, and which carried with it a blaze of truth
that flashed conviction on the mind of the royal transgressor.
Lessons of reproof, religion, and morality,
were, we find, continually delivered in this mode, by
the sages of old, to the exalted among mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
It is asserted by authors, that Apologues and Fables
had their origin in the Eastern world, and that the
most ancient of them were the productions of Veesh-nou
Sarma, commonly called Pilpay, whose beautiful
collections of Apologues were esteemed as sacred
books in India and Persia, whence they were spread
abroad among other nations, and were by them celebrated
and holden in much estimation. They were
translated from the Persian and Arabian into Greek,
by Simeon Seth, a man of great learning, who was an
officer of the imperial household at Constantinople
about the year 1070. Seth’s Version was imitated in
Latin by Piers Alfonse, a converted Jew, as early as
the year 1107; and this is supposed to have been the
first version of Pilpay’s Apologues that made its way,
and became familiarized in Europe. The time in
which Pilpay lived, seems not to be certainly known
to the learned; but some of them suppose that the
Fables of Æsop and others were grounded upon his
models. The time in which Æsop lived is better ascertained,
and of all the Fabulists who have amused
and instructed mankind by their writings, his name
stands pre-eminent. Authors fix his birth-place at
Cotieum, in Phrygia Major. But the history of this
remarkable person, who lived about 572 years before
Christ, and about 100 years before Herodotus, the
Greek historian, has been so involved in mystery, traditionary
stories, and absurd conjectures, that any attempt
to give a detail from such materials, would only
serve to bewilder youth, and lead them into a labyrinth
of error; and it would be impertinent to trouble
the learned reader with that which must be sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
familiar to him.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> The whole of the absurd
fictions concerning this wise and amiable man, were invented
by Maximus Planudes, a Greek monk.<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> Plutarch,
and other authentic historians,<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> have, however,
given a very different account of the illustrious Fabulist.
It would appear, according to some of these relations,
that Æsop, originally a shepherd’s boy, had risen
from the condition of a slave, to great eminence, and
that he lived in the service of Xanthus and Judman,
or Idmon, in the island of Samos, and afterwards
at Athens. Phædrus speaks of him as living the
greater part of his life at the latter place, where, it
appears, a handsome statue, executed by the hand of
the famous statuary Lysippus, was erected to his memory,
and placed before those of the seven sages of
Greece.<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> He also notices his living at Samos, and
interesting himself in a public capacity, in the administration
of the affairs of that place; where Aristotle also
introduces him as a public speaker, and records the
fact of his reciting the fable of the Fox and the Hedgehog,<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a>
while pleading on behalf of a minister, upon the
occasion of his being impeached for embezzling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
public treasure. Æsop is also mentioned as speaking
in a public capacity to the Athenians, at the time when
Pisistratus seized upon their liberties.<a id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> Upon each of
these occasions he is represented as having introduced a
Fable into his discourse, in a witty and pleasing manner.
He was holden in the highest veneration and esteem
in his day, by all men eminent for their wisdom and
virtue. It appears there was scarcely an author among
the ancient Greeks who mixed any thing of morality
in his writings, that did not either quote or mention
Æsop. Plato describes Socrates as turning some of
Æsop’s Fables into verse, during those awful hours
which he spent in prison, immediately before his death.
Aristophanes not only takes hints from Æsop, but mentions
him much to his honour, as one whose works
were, or ought to be, read before any other. Ennius
and Horace have embellished their poetry from his
stores; and ancient sages and authors all concur in
bearing the most ample testimony to his distinguished
merits. Plutarch, in his imaginary banquet of the
seven wise men, among several other illustrious persons
of ancient times, celebrated for their wit and knowledge,
introduces Æsop, and describes him as being
very courtly and polite in his behaviour. Upon the
authority of Plutarch also, we fix the life of Æsop in the
time of Crœsus, king of Lydia, who invited him to the
court of Sardis. By this prince, he was holden in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
esteem, as to be sent as his envoy to Periander, king of
Corinth, which was about three hundred and twenty
years after the time in which Homer lived, and 550
before Christ. He was also deputed by Crœsus to
consult the oracle of Delphi. While on this embassy,
he was ordered to distribute to each of the citizens,
four <em>minæ</em><a id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> of silver, but some disputes arising between
them and Æsop, he reproached them for their
indolence, in suffering their lands to lie uncultivated,
and in depending on the gratuities of strangers for a
precarious subsistence: the quarrel, which it would
appear ran high between them, ended in Æsop’s sending
back the money to Sardis. This so exasperated
the Delphians, that they resolved upon his destruction;
and that they might have some colour of justice for
what they intended, they concealed among his effects,
when he was taking his departure from Delphi, a gold
cup, consecrated to Apollo; and afterwards pursuing
him, easily found what they themselves had hidden.
On the pretext that he had committed this sacrilegious
theft, they carried him back to the city, and notwithstanding
his imprecating upon them the vengeance of
heaven, they immediately condemned him to be cast
from the rock Hypania, as the punishment of the
pretended crime. Ancient historians say, that for this
wickedness, the Delphians were for a long time visited
with pestilence and famine, until an expiation was
made, and then the plague ceased.</p>

by Sir Brooke Boothby, bart. from which this sketch is extracted.</p>

and absurdities of Planudes’s Life of Æsop, and collected what could be
known, was Bachet de Mezeriac, a man of great learning, who flourished
about the year 1632.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> These sages were Solon, Thales, Chilo, Cleobulus, Bias, Pittacus,

Epimenides, and Pisistratus.</p>

you; but if you put him to death, some needy person will fill his place,
whose wants must be supplied out of your property.”

<p>It was not until many ages after the death of Æsop,
that his most prominent successor, Phædrus, arose. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
translated Æsop’s Fables from the Greek into Latin,
and added to them many of his own. Of Phædrus
little is known, except from his works. He is said to
have lived in the times of the Emperors Augustus and
Tiberius, and to have died in the reign of the latter.
The first printed edition of his Fables, with cuts, was
published at Gauda, in 1482. Caxton published some
of them in 1484, and Bonus Accursius in 1489, to
which he prefixed Planudes’s Life of Æsop. But the
most perfect edition of Phædrus’s Works was published
in five volumes, by Peter Pithou, at Troyes, in 1596,
from manuscripts discovered by him in the cities of
Rheims and Dijon. To these have succeeded in later
times, a numerous list of fabulists,<a id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a> besides such of the
poets as have occasionally interspersed Fables in their
works. These, in their day, have had, and many of
them still have, their several admirers; but Gay and
Dodsley best maintain their ground in this country, as
is proved by the regular demand for new editions.
Croxall’s Fables, which were first published in 1722,
with cuts on metal, in the manner of wood, have also
had a most extensive sale; and Sir Brooke Boothby’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
elegant little volumes, in verse, published in 1809, are
now making their way into the public notice. The
Editor of the present volume, in attempting to continue
the same pleasing mode of conveying instruction, long
since laid down as a guide to virtue, has quoted and
compiled from other fabulists, whatever seemed best
suited to his purpose. His sole object is utility, and he
is not altogether without hope, that in attempting to
embellish and perpetuate a fabric, which has its foundations
laid in religion and morality, his efforts may
not be wholly ineffectual to induce the young to keep
steadily in view those great truths, which form the sure
land-mark to the haven, where only they can attain
peace and happiness.</p>

by the receding tide, were creeping again towards the
water, when the former observing the awkward gait of
her daughter, got into a great passion, and desired her
to move straight forward, in a more becoming and
sprightly manner, and not crawl sideling along in a way
so contrary to all the rest of the world. Indeed mother,
says the young Crab, I walk as properly as I can, and
to the best of my knowledge; but if you would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
me to go otherwise, I beg you would be so good as to

<p><span class="firstword">Ill</span> examples corrupt even the best natural disposition,
and it is in vain to instruct our children, their
talents being only imitation, to walk by one rule, if we
ourselves go by another. The good precepts which we
may lay down to them, will be bestowed in vain, if they
see by our own conduct, that we pursue a contrary
course to that which we recommend to them. Parents
therefore, who are desirous of working an effectual reformation
in their children, should begin by making a
visible amendment in themselves; and this is a duty
they owe to society, as well as to their offspring, it being
of the utmost importance to both, that probity and
honour be early instilled into their youthful minds, as
these grow with their growth, and while at the same
time they command respect, they lay the foundation of
their individual happiness through life.</p>

neglected, by natural instinct, leapt upon her back, and
so away they scampered together; but it unluckily fell
out, in the over-anxiety of her precipitate flight, confused
and blinded with haste, that she struck her favourite’s
head against a branch, which threw it on the
ground, where the darling bantling was seized by the
dogs and killed. The hated one, clinging close to her
rough back, escaped all the danger of the pursuit.</p>

<p>The indulgence which parents shew to their children
arises from the most amiable of human weaknesses; but
it is not the less injurious in its effects, and therefore
it is of great importance to guard against it, and not to
suffer a blind fondness to transport us beyond the bounds
of a discreet affection, for this often proves the ruin of
the child. This fable is also intended to expose the
folly of a system of favouritism in families, for experience
shews that those children who are the least pampered
and indulged usually make the best and cleverest
men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE BOY AND HIS MOTHER.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> little Boy having stolen a book from one of his
school-fellows, took it to his Mother, who, instead of
correcting him, praised his sharpness, and rewarded him.
In process of time, as he grew bigger, he increased also
in villainy, till at length he was taken up for committing
a great robbery, and was brought to justice and condemned
for it. As the officers were conducting him to
the gallows, he was attended by a vast crowd, and
among the rest his Mother came sobbing along, and
deploring her son’s unhappy fate; which the criminal
observing, he begged leave to speak to her: this being
granted, he put his mouth to her ear, as if he was going
to whisper something, and bit it off! The officer,
shocked at this behaviour, asked him if the crimes he
had committed were not sufficient to glut his wickedness,
without being also guilty of such an unnatural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
violence towards his mother? Let no one wonder, said
he, that I have done this to her, for she deserves even
worse at my hands. For if she had chastised instead of
praising and encouraging me, when I stole my school-fellow’s
book, I should not now have been brought to
this ignominious and untimely end.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> approaches to vice are by slow degrees, and the
good or evil bias given to youth is seldom eradicated.
The first deviations from sound morality should therefore
be most strictly watched, and wickedness checked
or punished in time; for when vice grows into a habit,
it becomes incurable, and both good governments and
private families are deeply concerned in its attendant
consequences. One need not scruple to affirm that
most of the depravity which is so frequent in the world,
and so pernicious to society, is owing to the bad education
of youth; and to the connivance or ill example of
their parents. It is therefore of the utmost consequence
that parents, guardians, and tutors, should be of characters
befitting them for the various and important
offices they have to perform. The latter description of
persons may and ought to be carefully selected; but it is
to be lamented that the base and mean-spirited hosts of
bad parents are out of the reach of controul, and
nothing can prevent the evils arising from their tutorage.
Perhaps it would be harsh to make laws to check the
marriages of such; but there is no need to encourage
the breed of them, for they are already over abundantly
numerous.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE MASTER AND HIS SCHOLAR.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">As</span> a School-master was walking upon the bank of a
river, he heard a cry as of one in distress: advancing a
few paces farther, he saw one of his Scholars in the
water, hanging by the branch of a willow. The Boy
had, it seems, been learning to swim with corks, and
now thinking himself sufficiently experienced, had
thrown these implements aside, and ventured into the
water without them; but the force of the stream having
hurried him out of his depth, he had certainly been
drowned, had not the branch of the tree providentially
hung in his way. The Master took up the corks,
which lay upon the ground, and throwing them to his
Scholar, made use of this opportunity to read a lecture
to him upon the inconsiderate rashness of youth. Let
this be an example to you, says he, in the conduct of
your future life, never to throw away your corks till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
time has given you strength and experience enough to
swim without them.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Rashness</span> is the peculiar vice of youth, and may be
stiled the characteristic foible of that season of life.
The foundation of this rashness is laid in a fond conceit
of their own abilities, which tempts them to undertake
affairs too great for their capacities, and to venture out
of their depths, or to suffer themselves to be hurried
into the most precipitate and dangerous measures, before
they find out their own weakness and inability. It
therefore behoves inexperienced young men to keep a
cautious guard over their passions, to check the irregularities
of their disposition, and to listen to the wholesome
advice and good council of those whose judgments
are matured by age and experience: for few are above
the need of advice, nor are we ever too old to learn
any thing for which we may be the better. But young
men, above all, should not disdain to open their eyes to
good example, and their ears to admonition: neither
should they be ashamed to borrow rules for their behaviour
in the world, until they are enabled from their
own knowledge of men and things, to stem its crooked
tides and currents with ease and honour to themselves.</p>

hear all that can be said on either side) that before the
pleadings are over, it is time to go to dinner.”</p>

<p>Indolence is like a stream which flows slowly on, but
yet it undermines every virtue; it rusts the mind, and
gives a tincture to every action of one’s life, the term of
which does not allow time for long protracted deliberations;
and yet how many waste more of their time in
idly considering which of two affairs to begin first, than
would have ended them both? To-morrow is still the
fatal time when all is to be done; to-morrow comes, it
goes, and still indolence pleases itself with the shadow,
while it loses the substance: and thus men pass through
life like a bird through the air, and leave no track behind
them, unmindful that the present time alone is
ours, and should be managed with judicious care, since
we cannot secure a moment to come, nor recal one
that is past. It is no matter how many good qualities
the mind may be possessed of; they all lie dormant if
we want the necessary vigour and resolution to draw
them forth; for this slumber of the mind leaves no difference
between the greatest genius and the meanest
understanding. Neither the mind nor the body can be
active and vigorous without proper exertion, and trouble
springs from idleness, and grievous toil from useless
ease; therefore, “whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
do it with all thy might, for there is no work, nor device,
nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither
thou goest.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE YOUNG MAN AND THE SWALLOW.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> prodigal thoughtless young Man, who had wasted
his whole patrimony in taverns and gaming-houses,
among his lewd idle companions, was taking a melancholy
walk near a brook. It was in the spring, while
the hills were yet capped with snow, but it happened to
be one of those clear sunny days which some times occur
at that time of the year; and to make appearances
the more flattering, a Swallow which had been
invited forth by the warmth, flew skimming along upon
the surface of the water. The Youth observing this,
concluded that the summer was now come, and that he
should have little or no occasion for clothes, so went
and pawned them, and ventured the money for one
stake more, among his sharping associates. When this
too was gone, like all the rest of his property, he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
another solitary walk in the same place as before, but
the weather being severe and frosty, every thing had
put on a very different aspect; the brook was frozen
over, and the poor Swallow lay dead upon the bank.
At this, the Youth, smarting under the sense of his own

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">They</span> who frequent taverns and gaming-houses, and
keep bad company, should not wonder if they are reduced
in a very short time to penury and want. The
wretched young fellows who once addict themselves to
such a scandalous course of life, scarcely think of or attend
to any thing besides: they seem to have nothing
else in their heads but how they may squander what
they have got, and where they may get more when that
is gone. They do not make the same use of their reason
as other people, but like the jaundiced eye, view
every thing in a false light, and having turned a deaf
ear to all advice, and pursued their unaltered course until
all their property is irrecoverably lost, when at
length misery forces upon them a sense of their situation,
they still lay the blame upon any cause but the
right one—their own extravagance and folly; like
the Prodigal in the fable, who would not have considered
a solitary occurrence as a general indication of the
season, had not his own wicked desires blinded his
understanding.</p>

I thank you, my dear friend, replied the Fuller, for
your kind offer; but it cannot be, for if I were to dwell

make clean in the morning, the dust of you and your
coals would blacken and defile before night.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is of no small importance in life to be cautious

course, it will be almost impossible for us to escape
being drawn in with them. If we are truly wise, and
would shun those rocks of pleasure upon which so many
have split, we should forbid ourselves all manner of
commerce and correspondence with those who are steering
a course, which reason tells us is not only not for
our advantage, but would end in our destruction. All
the virtue we can boast of, will not be sufficient to insure
our safety, if we embark in bad company; for
though our philosophy were such as would preserve us
from being tainted and infected with their manners, yet
their characters would twist and entwine themselves
along with ours, in so intricate a fold, that the world
would not take the trouble to unravel and separate
them. Reputation is of a blending nature, like water;
that which is derived from the clearest spring, if it
chance to mix with a foul current, runs on undistinguished,
in one muddy stream, and must ever partake
of the colour and condition of its associate.</p>

all his life, made use of this expedient. He
called them to his bed-side, and said: All the patrimony
I have to bequeath to you, my sons, is my farm
and my vine-yard, of which I make you joint heirs;
but I charge you not to let them go out of your own
occupation, for if I have any treasure besides, it lies
buried somewhere in the ground within a foot of the
surface. This made the Sons conclude that he talked of
money which he had hidden: so after their father’s
death, with unwearied diligence, they carefully dug up
every inch, and though they found not the money they
expected, the ground, by being well stirred and loosened,
produced so plentiful a crop of all that was sown in
it, as proved a real, and that no inconsiderable treasure.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> good name and the good counsel of a father,
are the best legacies he can leave to his children; and
they ought to revere the one, and keep in mind the

industry affords him greater pleasure in the enjoyment,
than when acquired in any other way; and men who
by personal labour have obtained a competency, know
its value better than those can who have had it showered
upon them without any efforts of their own. Idleness
engenders disease, while exercise is the great prop of
health, and health is the greatest blessing of life, which
consideration alone ought to stimulate men to pursue
some useful employment; and among the almost endless
number of those, to which good laws and well-organized
society give birth and encouragement, there
are none equal to the culture of the earth, none which
yield a more grateful return. The pleasures derived
both from agriculture and horticulture, are so various, so
delightful, and so natural to man, that they are not easily
to be described, and are never to be excelled: for in
whatever way they are pursued, the mind may be constantly
entertained with the wonderful œconomy of the
vegetable world; and the nerves are invigorated and
kept in proper tone by the freshness of the earth, and
the fragrancy of the air, which blush the countenance
with health, and give a relish to every meal.</p>

<p>How many vain people, of moderate easy circumstances,

upon living within our income, and to endeavour by
honesty, sobriety, and industry, to maintain our ground.
Young men, upon their launching out into the world,
would do well deeply to reflect upon this, for their future
peace of mind and happiness greatly depend upon
it. They need only look a little about them to see
how a contrary conduct has operated upon thousands;
and it is to be feared, will continue to fill our gaols with
debtors, and Bedlam with lunatics.</p>

they look so very long and unsightly, that I had rather

was alarmed with the cry of a pack of hounds. Away
he flies in some consternation, and bounding nimbly
over the plain, threw dogs and men at a vast distance
behind him. After which, taking a very thick copse, he
had the ill fortune to be entangled by his horns in the
branches, where he was held fast till the hounds came
up and seized him. In the pangs of death, he is said
to have uttered these words: Unhappy creature that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> often make a false estimate, in preferring our
ornamental talents to our useful ones, and are apt to

our vanity is stronger than our reason, show and ostentation
find easy admission into our hearts, and we are
much fonder of specious trifles than useful plainness.
But the truest mark of wisdom is to estimate things at
their just value, and to know whence the most solid
advantages may be derived: otherwise, like the Stag
in the Fable, we may happen to admire those accomplishments
which are not only of no real use, but often
prove prejudicial to us, while we despise those things
on which our safety may depend. He that does not
know himself, will often form a false judgment upon
other matters that most materially concern him; and
thus it fares with many, who suffer themselves to be
deluded with the false pomp of high life, and whose
vanity prompts them to conceive they possess talents
which qualify them to shine in that circle, into which,
had they judged rightly, they never would have entered,
but rather have applied themselves to improve
other qualifications, which might have insured their own
happiness, and have rendered them useful members of
society.</p>

the forest, he treated them all without distinction in the
most haughty and disdainful manner. But the Fox
being among them, went up to him with a great deal of
spirit and resolution, and told him that he was mistaken
in the value he was pleased to set upon himself, since
people of judgment were not used to form their opinion
of merit from an outside appearance, but by considering
the good qualities and endowments with which the mind
was stored within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Wise</span> men are chiefly captivated with the beauty of
the mind, rather than that of the person; and whenever
they are infatuated with a passion for any thing else, it
is generally observed that they cease, during that time
at least, to be what they were, and indeed are only considered
to be playing the fool. It too often happens
that women of remarkable beauty are so fully satisfied
with their outward excellencies, that they totally neglect
the improvement of their minds; not considering that it
is only a combination of mental and personal charms
that can entitle them to be ranked as Nature’s greatest
ornaments. Unmindful of this, however, they are too
apt to consider beauty as the only thing requisite in
their sex; and since they are endowed with it in such
an eminent degree, they look down with disdain on females
less happy in personal charms. Beauty has undoubtedly
great influence over the hearts of mankind,
but when it is overrun with affectation and conceit,
their admiration will soon be turned into disgust; while
women of more ordinary persons, but blessed with good
sense and good humour, will captivate the hearts of
worthy men, and more effectually secure their constancy.</p>

Crane, as some mean ordinary person. The Crane resolving

that Peacocks were very fine birds indeed, if fine feathers
could make them so; but that he thought it a
much nobler thing to be able to rise above the clouds
into endless space, and survey the wonders of the heavens,
as well as of the earth beneath, with its seas, lakes,

whether it consist of the beauties of the person, or the

kind of misguided pride, while it endeavours to exalt,
commonly tends to lower the persons who are infected
with it; but never renders them so truly ridiculous as
when it inspires them with a contempt of those who
have ten times more worth than themselves. To value
ourselves upon the glitter and finery of dress is one of
the most trifling of all vanities; and a man of sense
would be ashamed to bestow upon it the least attention.
They who examine things by the scale of common sense,
must find something of weight and substance before they
can be persuaded to set a value upon it. The mind
that is stored with virtuous and rational sentiments, and
the behaviour which is founded upon complacency and
humility, stamp a value upon the possessor, which all
men of discernment are ever ready to admire and acknowledge.</p>

of inestimable worth: they are built upon the tenderest

have already travelled over the difficult paths of life,
and buffeted its storms, have observed the snares and
the dangers with which the way is strewed, and they are
enabled by their experience, to forewarn those who are
about to launch out on the troubled ocean of life, to
steer their course clear of its hidden rocks, its shoals,
and its quick-sands. Did youth but know the importance
of this early advice, how eagerly would they

milk and curds, and sometimes threw him a bone extraordinary.
Yet, notwithstanding this, no sooner was
his back turned, than the treacherous Cur fell upon
some one of the flock, and thus devoured the sheep instead
of guarding and defending them. The Shepherd
having at length found out his tricks, was resolved to

and why he did not rather take vengeance on the Wolf

the Shepherd, it is for that very reason that I think

judgment, mistaking the reason of things, and imputing
the issue of them to wrong causes. We should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
endeavour to content ourselves in our present station,
if it be not very bad indeed, for it seldom happens that
every thing can be in all respects agreeable to our
wishes. When we give full scope to the impatience of
our tempers, and quit our present condition in life, we
often find we have not changed for the better; but we
are too fond of carving out our fortunes for ourselves,
and wish to remove this or that obstacle which we imagine
stands between us and our felicity: then, too late,
we see how greatly we are mistaken in our notions,
when we feel we have changed for the worse. Before
we attempt any alteration of moment, we should, if
possible, ascertain what state it will produce, and not
suffer infirmity of temper to embitter our lives; but,
above all, we should never aim at mending our fortunes
by fraud and violence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">HERCULES AND THE CARTER.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">As</span> a clownish Fellow was driving his cart along a
deep miry lane, the wheels stuck so fast in the clay,
that his horses could not draw it out. Upon this he
fell a bawling and praying to Hercules to come and
help him. Hercules, looking down from a cloud, bid
him not lie there like an idle dastardly looby as he was,
but get up and whip his horses, and clap his shoulder
stoutly to the wheel, adding that this was the only way
for him to obtain assistance.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> man who sits down at his ease, and prays to
Heaven to have all his wants supplied, and his wishes
accomplished, by a miracle wrought in his favour,
without using his own exertions and honest endeavours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
to obtain them, deserves to be disappointed. Many
men who have a fair share of natural good sense, and
who also value themselves upon having their reasoning
powers enlightened by revelation, yet fall into this
error: led by fanatics and bigots, they follow the fashion
of running often to prayers and sermons, when
they might be much better employed at home. The industrious
good man, instead of publicly praying for the
comforts of life, pursues his business, which is the proper
means of procuring them; and if at the same time
he holds converse with his Maker, which all men ought
to do, and no man can be happy without doing, he
needs no veil of hypocrisy to make the world believe
he is better than he really is: he feels it his duty and
pleasure so to proceed, while he sojourns here, and
knows not how he can do better, than by sober and
honest industry to provide for those of his own household,
and to endeavour for the means of helping him
that needeth. The man who is virtuously and honestly
engaged, is actually serving God all the while; and is
more likely to have his silent wishes, accompanied with
strenuous endeavours, complied with by the Supreme
Being, than he who begs with an unnecessary vehemence,
and solicits with an empty hand—a hand which
would be more religious, were it usefully employed,
and more devout, were it stretched out to do good to
those that want it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE EAGLE, THE CAT, AND THE SOW.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> Eagle had built her nest upon the top branches
of an old oak; a Wild Cat inhabited a hole in the middle;
and in the hollow part at the bottom was a Sow
with a whole litter of Pigs. A happy neighbourhood,
and might long have continued so, had it not been for
the wicked insinuations of the designing Cat: for first
of all, up she crept to the Eagle, and, Good neighbour,
says she, we shall all be undone; that filthy Sow
yonder does nothing but lie rooting at the foot of the
tree, and, as I suspect, intends to grub it up, that she
may the more easily come at our young ones. For my
part, I will take care of my own concerns, you may do
as you please; but I will watch her motions, though I
stay at home this month for it. When she had said
this, which could not fail of putting the Eagle into a
great fright, down she went, and made a visit to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Sow at the bottom: putting on a sorrowful face, I hope,
says she, you do not intend to go abroad to-day: why
not? says the Sow: nay, replies the other, you may do
as you please, but I overheard the Eagle tell her young
ones, that she would treat them with a Pig the first
time she saw you go out; and I am not sure but she
may take up with a Kitten in the mean time; so good
morrow to you, you will excuse me, I must go and
take care of the little folks at home. Away she went
accordingly, and by contriving to steal out softly at
nights for her prey, and to stand watching and peeping
all day at her hole, as under great concern, she made
such an impression upon the Eagle and the Sow, that
neither of them dared to venture abroad, for fear of
the other; the consequence of which was, that they
in a little time were starved, and their young ones fell
a prey to the treacherous Cat and her Kittens.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE LARK AND HER YOUNG ONES.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Lark who had Young Ones in a field of corn
nearly ripe, was under some fear lest the reapers
should come and cut it down before her young brood
were fledged, and able to remove from the place;
wherefore, when she flew abroad in the morning to
seek for food for them, she charged them to listen to
what the Farmer said about shearing. On her return,
her young family opened all their little throats at once,
to inform her that the Farmer had sent to his neighbours
to reap the corn the next morning. Is that all?
said the old Lark, then there is no danger. When
she went abroad again the next morning, she left the
same instructions as before. At night, she found her
Young Ones more alarmed than at first; for the Farmer
had applied to his friends, earnestly requesting them
to begin the harvest the next day. She received this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
intelligence as calmly as before, and took no other
precautions the next day, than repeating the same orders.
In the evening, they told her that the Farmer
had been charging his son to get the sickles ready, for
it was in vain to wait for other people, and that they
would cut the corn to-morrow themselves. Nay, then
said the old Lark, we must be off as soon as we can; for
when a man undertakes to do his business himself, it is
not so likely that he will be disappointed.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">He</span> who depends on the assistance of others to perform
what he is able to do himself, must not be surprised
to find that his business is neglected. He may
be sure that it will be best done when he puts forth his
own hands, and looks after it with his own eyes. How
indeed can any man imagine, that other people will be
active in his interest, while he himself remains indolent
and unconcerned about his own affairs. Men of such
tempers and dispositions, live in a state of suspense,
and subject themselves to perpetual disappointments
and losses, which their own industry would have prevented,
and have kept their minds at ease. They do
not use their reasoning powers, but sink down into a
kind of stupid abject dependence upon others, which
degrades even the finest talents with which human
nature is dignified.</p>

back was turned, one of them snatched up a piece of
beef, and gave it to his companion, who clapt it under
his cloak. The Cook turning about, and missing his
beef, began to charge them with it: upon which he
that first took it swore bitterly he had none of it. He
that had it, swore as heartily that he had not taken it.
Why, look ye, gentlemen, says the Cook, I see your
equivocation; and though I cannot tell which of you
has taken my meat, I am sure between you there is a
thief.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> fable shews how little reliance can be placed
on either the word or the oath of those who, like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
thieves in the cook’s shop, have neither honour nor
honesty. An honest man’s word is as good as his
oath; and so is a rogue’s too: for he that will cheat
and lie, will not scruple to forswear himself. The
former needs no oath to bind him; and the latter,
though he swear in the most solemn manner that can
be invented, only deceives you the more certainly, as
he who scruples not to steal, will never regard the
heinous guilt of calling upon the Supreme Being to
witness his atrocity. It is no less wicked to quibble
and evade the truth, than it is to deny it altogether,
for the falsehood consists in what we wish the hearer
to believe, not in the literal import of what we say.
Men who habituate themselves to this species of deceit,
will soon be ready to go the length of any perjury.
Early to impress the mind with the unspeakable worth
of truth, is of the utmost importance. It is sacred,
and no man can say in the face of the world, that it
ought not to prevail. No discussions can injure its
cause—it emanates from heaven—it is an attribute of
omnipotence, and is therefore eternal.</p>

from hill to dale in all the wildness of unbridled restraint.
Why should not I, said he to himself, be as
good a racer as any horse whatever? My father,
whose pedigree was well known, was one of the best
of them; do not I resemble him in every respect?
While he was indulging his vanity in reveries of
this kind, his master having occasion to mount him
upon urgent business, put him upon his speed, and,
ere long, was obliged to use both whip and spur to
force him to push forward. Thus jaded and tired,
he muttered to himself, Alas! I find now, I was mistaken

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> man who has been brought up in ease and
affluence, and pampered and anticipated in all his
wants, little imagines what a figure he would make in
the world, were his supplies cut off, and he were put
to the trial to rub through its thorny mazes, and provide
for himself. The children of the poor industrious
honest man, when brought up like their parents, are
put to a kind of school, such as the opulent it is feared
can seldom form any conception of; and if the former,
by their industry and abilities, rise above poverty, their
enjoyments in life commonly surpass those who have
been, without effort, upheld in every real as well as
imaginary want. The sensible poor man does not
trouble his head about his pedigree, but he knows that
his descent must of course be as ancient as that of any
man on earth; and that if he is respected in the world,
it must arise solely from his own good conduct and
merit. The man who has nothing to boast but the
merely tracing back his ancestry, is building upon a
hollow foundation. If indeed his ancestry have arisen
to their high station by patriotic and virtuous means,
and have deservedly maintained a high character for
probity, worth, and honour, let him follow their example:
if otherwise, all he can do or say will only
prove him to be a mongrel, or an ass.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> gallant young Cock, in company with his mistresses,
raking upon a dung-hill for something to entertain
them with, happened to scratch up a Jewel.
He knew what it was well enough, for it sparkled with
an exceeding bright lustre; but not knowing what to
do with it, he shrugged up his wings, shook his head,
and putting on a grimace, expressed himself to this
purpose: Indeed, you are a very fine thing; but I
know not any business you have here. I make no
scruple of declaring, that my taste lies quite another
way; and I had rather have one grain of dear, delicious
barley, than all the Jewels under the sun.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Moralists</span> have interpreted this Fable in various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
ways, some of them ascribing the want of setting a

<p class="in0">But the most obvious meaning of the Fable is surely
to shew, that men who weigh well their own real
wants, and shape their pursuits to their abilities, will
always prefer those things which are necessary, to such
as are merely ornamental or superfluous, and will not
easily suffer themselves to be led astray by the gaudy
allurements of glitter and show, which have no other
value than what vanity, pride, or luxury may have set
upon them; but governing their minds by their own
reason, judge of every thing by its intrinsic worth.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Man was felling a tree on the steep bank of a
river, and by chance let slip his hatchet, which dropt
into the water, and sunk to the bottom. Being in distress
for want of his tool, he sat down and bemoaned
himself on the occasion. Upon this, Mercury appeared
to him, and being informed of the cause of his
complaint, dived to the bottom of the river, and coming
up again, shewed the Man a golden hatchet, demanding
if that were his? he denied that it was: upon
which Mercury dived a second time, and brought up
a silver one; the Man refused it, alleging likewise
that it was not his: he dived a third time, and fetched
up the individual hatchet the Man had lost; upon
sight of which the poor fellow was overjoyed, and took
it with all humility and thankfulness. Mercury was
so pleased with his honesty, that he gave him the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
into the bargain, as a reward for his just dealing.
Away goes the Man to his companions, and giving
them an account of what had happened, one of them
went presently to the river’s side, and let his hatchet
fall designedly into the stream. Then sitting down
upon the bank, he fell to weeping and lamenting as if
he had been really and sorely afflicted. Mercury appeared
as before, and diving, brought him up a golden
hatchet, asking if that were the hatchet he had lost?
Transported at the precious metal, he answered yes,
and went to snatch it greedily; but the God, detesting
his abominable impudence, not only refused him
that, but would not so much as let him have his own
again.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Honesty</span> is the best policy; and one of our best
poets has further stamped a value upon the good old
maxim, by his assertion that “an honest man is the

are so plain, direct, and easy, that the man
who pursues them, stands in no need of subtle contrivances
to deceive the world. He listens to the
honest monitor within, and makes good his professions
with his practice: neither gold nor silver hatchets
can make him deviate from it; and whatever situation
he may be placed in, he is sure to meet the esteem of
all men within the circle in which he moves, and has
besides the constant pleasure of feeling self-approbation
within his own breast.</p>

appearance I make, and what a life of ease I lead:
I go where I please, and frisk about in the sunshine,
or lie down under the cool shade, just as my own fancy
prompts me. The Ox, not moved by this insolence,
made no reply, but pursued his daily round of alternate
labour and rest, until he saw the Calf taken and
delivered to a priest, who immediately led him to the
altar, and prepared to sacrifice him. When the fatal
knife was just at his throat, the Ox drew near, and
whispered him to this purpose: see what your wanton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>

painful death.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> may learn by this Fable the general consequence
of an idle life, and how well rewarded laborious
diligent men are in the end, when they quietly
enjoy the fruits of their industry. They who by little
tricks and chicanery, or by open violence and robbery,
are enabled to live in a high expensive way, often despise
the poor honest man, who is contented with the
humble produce of his daily labour. But how often
is the poor man comforted, by seeing these wanton
villains led in disgrace and misery to the altar of justice,
while he has many a cheerful summer’s morning
to enjoy abroad, and many a long winter’s evening to
indulge in at home, by a quiet hearth, and under an
unenvied roof: blessings, which often attend a sober
industrious man, though the idle and the profligate
are utter strangers to them. Luxury and intemperance,
besides their inevitable tendency to shorten a
man’s days, are very apt to engage their besotted
votaries in a debauched life, not only prejudicial to
their health, but which engenders in them a contempt
for those whose good sense and true taste of
happiness inspire them with an aversion to idleness
and effeminacy, and put them upon hardening their
constitution by innocent exercise and laudable employment.
How many do gluttony and sloth tumble
into an untimely grave! while the temperate and the
active drink sober draughts of life, and spin out the
thread of their existence to the most desirable length.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE BOASTING TRAVELLER.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">One</span> who had been abroad, was giving an account
of his travels, and among other places, said he had
been at Rhodes, where he had distinguished himself
so much in leaping, an exercise which that city was
famous for, that not a Rhodian could come near him.
When those who were present did not seem to credit
this relation so readily as he intended they should, he
took some pains to convince them of it by oaths and
protestations: upon which, one of the company told
him he need not give himself so much trouble about
it, since he would put him in a way to demonstrate
the fact; which was, to suppose the place they were
in to be Rhodes, and to perform his extraordinary
leap over again. The boaster, not liking this proposal,
sat down quietly, and had no more to say for
himself.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> had better be contented to keep our exploits
to ourselves, than to appear ridiculous by attempting
to force a belief of that which is improbable; and travelled
gentlemen should have a care how they import
falsehoods and inventions of their own from foreign
parts, and attempt to vend them at home for staple
truths. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon
the mind, that a lie is upon all occasions degrading
to the person who utters it, and should be most scrupulously
avoided, not only on account of its baseness,
but because it is impossible to foresee in how many
troubles it may involve him who passes it off. It will
not always receive credit, and is ever liable to detection.
When it is calculated for wicked purposes, it
will deservedly incur punishment; and when it is of a
harmless or insignificant nature, it will even then often
expose its author to contempt and ridicule; and vanity
never mistakes its end more grossly, than when it
attempts to aggrandize itself at the expence of truth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE SHEPHERD’S BOY AND THE WOLF.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Shepherd’s Boy, while attending his flock, used
frequently to divert himself by crying out, “the
Wolf! the Wolf!” The Husbandmen in the adjoining
grounds, thus alarmed, left their work and
ran to his assistance, but finding that he was only
sporting with their feelings, and bantering them, they
resolved at last to take no notice of his alarms. It
was not long, however, before the Wolf really came,
and the Boy bawled out “the Wolf! the Wolf!” as
he had done before; but the men having been so often
deceived, paid no attention to his cries, and the sheep
were devoured without mercy.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> man who would go through the world with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
reputation and success, must preserve a religious adherence
to truth: for no talents or industry can give
him weight with others, or induce the sensible part
of mankind to place any confidence in him, if he be
known to deviate without scruple from veracity. Men
of this stamp soon become notorious; and besides the
ignominy which attaches to their characters, they have
to undergo the mortification of not being believed even
when they do speak the truth. Whatever misfortune
may befal them, and however sincere they may be in
making known their distress, yet, like the boy in the
Fable, their complaints and most earnest asseverations
cannot procure them credit, and are received at best
with doubt and suspicion. The same consequences
follow falsehood and deception, whether practised by
individuals or public governors, and they will both
find in the end that they have been guided by cunning,
and not by wisdom: for although the ignorant part
of mankind may, to serve the temporary purposes of
a bad government, be acted upon by false alarms of
imaginary dangers, yet even these in time will see
through the stale tricks and artifices of those whose
designs are to gull and impose upon them.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Crow, ready to die with thirst, flew with joy to
a Pitcher which he beheld at some distance. When
he came, he found water in it, indeed, but so near the
bottom, that with all his stooping and straining, he
was not able to reach it. He then endeavoured to
overturn the Pitcher, that at least he might be able
to get a little of it; but his strength was not sufficient
for the accomplishment of this purpose. At last seeing
some pebbles lie near the place, he cast them one by
one into the Pitcher, and thus, by degrees, raised the
water up to the very brim, and satisfied his thirst.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">What</span> we cannot accomplish by strength, we may

penetration, upon meeting with a few difficulties, does
not drop his pursuits, but if he cannot succeed in one
way, sets his mind to work upon another, and does
not hesitate about stepping out of the old beaten track
which had been thoughtlessly pursued in a roundabout
way by thousands before him. The present state of
the world, enlightened by arts and sciences, is a proof
that difficulties seemingly unsurmountable, and undertakings
once imagined to be impossible, have been
accomplished; and this ought to be kept in mind as a

feathers out of one of its wings, and turned it into a
little yard where he kept Game Cocks. The Cocks
led the poor bird a sad life, continually pecking at
and driving it away from the meat. This treatment
was taken the more unkindly, because offered to a
stranger; and the Partridge could not help concluding
that they were the most uncivil inhospitable people
he had ever met with. But observing how very frequently
they quarrelled and fought with each other,
he comforted himself with reflecting, that it was no
wonder they were so cruel to him, since they shewed
the same disposition to each other.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">No</span> peace is to be expected among those who are
naturally fierce, quarrelsome, and inhospitable; and
people of a different disposition should avoid, as much
as possible, having any thing to do with them. But
when we cannot help coming into contact with such
characters, there is no remedy but patience; and this
virtue a wise man will call to his aid under every misfortune.
When our sufferings are inflicted by the
wickedness of others, it is some consolation to reflect,
that people of this character are continually waging
war among themselves, and punishing each other; and
that the consequences of their own wickedness follow
them like their shadow, besides rendering them the
objects of general aversion. No virtue was more universally
practised, or more strongly recommended, by
the ancients, than a mild conduct to our companions,
and an hospitable entertainment of strangers; and
when this is not the general character of any people,
it shews, in greater or less degrees, the wretched state
of society in which they live.</p>

graceful turn of body is there! and I make no question
but you have a tolerable voice: if it be but as fine

with this very civil language, wriggled about, and
hardly knew where she was; and having a mind to
convince the Fox in the matter of her voice, attempted
to sing, and in the same instant let the meat drop out
of her mouth. This being what the Fox wanted, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>

seizing the most guarded heart. How many are tickled
to the last degree with the pleasure of flattery, even
while they are applauded for their honest detestation
of it. There is no way to baffle the force of this engine,
but by every one’s examining impartially for
himself, the true estimate of his own qualities. If he
deal sincerely in the matter, nobody can tell so well
as himself, what degree of esteem ought to attend any
of his actions; and therefore he should be entirely
easy as to the opinion others have of them. If they
attribute more to him than is his due, they are either
designing, or mistaken; if they allow him less, they
are envious, or possibly still mistaken; and in either
case are to be despised or disregarded: for he that

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Swallow, observing a Farmer sowing his field
with flax, called the Birds together, and informed them
what he was about. She told them that flax was the
material of which the thread was made that composed
the fowler’s nets, so fatal to the feathered race, and
strongly advised them to assist her in picking up the
seed, and destroying it. The Birds heard her with
indifference, and gave themselves no trouble about the
matter. In a little time the flax sprung up, and appeared
above the ground. She then put them in mind
once more of their impending danger, and wished
them to pluck it up in the bud, before it grew any
farther. But they still slighted her warnings, and the
flax grew up into stalk. She again urged them to
attack it, for it was not yet too late; but they only
ridiculed her for a silly pretending prophet. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
Swallow, finding all her remonstrances availed nothing,
was resolved to leave the society of such careless
unthinking creatures, before it was too late: so quitting
the woods, she repaired to the houses; and, forsaking
the conversation of the Birds, has ever since
taken up her abode among the dwellings of men.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Wise</span> men read effects in their causes, and profit

danger, till it is too late to prevent it. In both cases,
those who have no foresight of their own, and those
who despise the wholesome admonitions of their friends,
deserve to suffer from the misfortunes which their
own obstinacy, folly, or negligence, brings upon their
heads. A great portion of mankind, from an overweening
conceit of their own abilities, are unwilling
to be advised by any one, and through this stubborn
disposition, deprive themselves of the aids of friendship,
and the benefits which the good-will of their
more sensible neighbours would have conferred on
them with pleasure.</p>

we cannot rob in quiet for you.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> same thing which recommends us to the esteem

of life, fiend-like, makes himself, as it were, the natural
adversary of virtue. It is in vain for innocent
men, under oppression, to complain to those who are
the occasion of it: all they can urge will but make
against them; and even their very innocence, though
they should say nothing, would render them sufficiently
suspected. The moral, therefore, that this Fable
brings along with it, is to inform us that there is no
trusting, nor any hopes of living well, with wicked unjust
men; for their disposition is such, that they will
do mischief to others as soon as they have the opportunity.
When vice flourishes, and is in power, were
it possible for a good man to live quietly in its neighbourhood,
and preserve his integrity, it might be sometimes
perhaps convenient for him to do so, rather than
quarrel with and provoke it against him. But as it is
certain that rogues are irreconcileable enemies to men
of worth, if the latter would be secure, they must take
methods to free themselves from the power and society
of the former.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">If</span> the kind enquiries after the sick were all to be

proceed from much the same motive with that which
induced the hungry Wolves to make their enquiries
after the sick Ass, namely, that they may come in for
some share of their remains, and feast themselves upon
the reversion of their goods and chattels. The sick
man’s heir longs for his estate; one friend waits in
anxious expectation of a legacy, and another wants
his place; it, however, does not unfrequently happen,
that the mask of these selfish visitants, and their counterfeit

vexation to others, whenever they have an opportunity

any change he can make must be for the better. He
loses sight of the virtues of patience, constancy, and

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE FORESTER AND THE LION.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Forester meeting with the Lion one day, they
discoursed together for a while without much differing
in opinion. At last, a dispute happening to arise
about the point of superiority between a Man and a
Lion, the former wanting a better argument, shewed
the latter a marble monument, on which was placed
the statue of a Man striding over a vanquished Lion.
If this, says the Lion, is all you have to say for it, let
us be the sculptors, and we will make the Lion striding
over the Man.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Such</span> is the partiality of mankind in favour of
themselves and their own actions, that it is extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
difficult, nay almost impossible to come at any certainty,
by reading the accounts that are written on
one side only. The simple truth is still perverted, as
prejudice, vanity, or interest warps the mind, and it
is not discovered in all its brilliancy, till the mists
which obscure it are swept away by the most rigid investigation.
In what an odious light would our party
men place each other, if the transactions of the times
were handed down to posterity by a warm zealot on
either side; and were such records to survive a few
centuries, with what perplexities and difficulties would
they embarrass the historian, as by turns he consulted
them for the character of his great forefathers. The
same difficulties would occur in writing the history of
nations, both ancient and modern. Some of those
who flourish at this day, and consider themselves as
having reached perfection in civilization and polished
manners, will perhaps, not unjustly, be branded in
after-times with cruelty, injustice, and oppression, in
having confounded all simplicity of manners, and disturbed
the peace of whole nations, by carrying the
horrors of war, of murder, and desolation, into regions
formerly blessed with uninterrupted tranquillity.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Wolf indicted the Fox for felony before the
Ape, who upon that occasion was appointed special
judge of the cause. The Fox gave in his answer to
the Wolf’s accusation, and denied the fact. After
hearing both sides, the Ape, penetrating the character
of the parties, gave judgment to this purpose: I am
of opinion, that you, says he to the Wolf, never lost
the goods you sue for; and as for you, turning to the
Fox, I make no question but you at least have stolen
what is laid to your charge. And thus the court was
dismissed with this public censure upon each party.</p>

justly enough accuse the other, though neither of them
are worthy of belief, and deserve even no credit for
the imputations with which they asperse each other’s

with, and shew a proper disgust at the wicked impudence
of both plaintiff and defendant.</p>

periwig, and exposed his bald pate. The company
could not forbear laughing at the accident; and he
himself laughed as loud as any body, saying, how was

<p><span class="firstword">There</span> is no disposition, or turn of mind, which

ingenuous and pleasant remark, parry the jest which
another is ready to throw out at our expence. To
appear fretted or nettled, only serves to gratify the
wishes of those who take a secret pleasure in seeing
such an effect produced; and, besides, a testy or captious
temper is a source of perpetual disquietude, both
to ourselves and our acquaintances, and like a little
leaven, sours the whole mass of our good qualities. If
we had no other imperfections, this of itself would be
sufficient to cause our company to be shunned.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Four</span> Bulls, who had entered into a very strict
friendship, kept always near one another, and fed together.
The Lion often saw them, and as often had
a mind to make one of them his prey; but though he
could easily have subdued any of them singly, yet he
was afraid to attack the whole alliance, knowing they
would have been too powerful for him, and therefore
was obliged to keep himself at a distance. At
last, perceiving that no attempt was to be made upon
them as long as their combination lasted, he artfully
contrived, by the whispers and hints of his emissaries,
to foment jealousies, and raise divisions among them.
This stratagem succeeded so well, that the Bulls grew
cold and reserved to one another, which soon after ripened
into a downright hatred and aversion, and at
last ended in a total separation. The Lion had now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
attained his ends; and though it had been impossible
for him to hurt them while they were united, he found
no difficulty, now they were parted, to seize and devour
every Bull of them, one after another.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

be too often cautioned against suffering them to

we lose a friend, we shake the very basis
of our interest, and remove the pillar that contributed
to support it. Whatever in cases of this kind is applicable

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE OLD MAN AND HIS SONS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> old Man had several Sons, who were constantly
quarrelling with each other, notwithstanding he used
every means in his power to persuade them to cease
their contentions, and to live in amity together. At
last he had recourse to the following expedient:—He
ordered his Sons to be called before him, and a
bundle of sticks to be brought, and then commanded
them to try if, with all their strength, any of them
could break it. They all tried, but without effect:
for the sticks being closely and compactly bound together,
it was impossible for the force of man to break
them. After this, the Father ordered the bundle to
be untied, and gave a single stick to each of his Sons,
at the same time bidding them try to break it. This
they did with ease, and soon snapped every stick asunder.
The Father then addressed them to this effect:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
O, my Sons, behold the power of unity! for if you,
in like manner, would but keep yourselves strictly
conjoined in the bands of friendship, it would not be
in the power of any mortal to hurt you; but when
you are divided by quarrels and animosities, you fall
a prey to the weakest enemies.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation;
and the same holds good in all societies and corporations
of men, from the constitution of the nation,
down to every little parochial vestry. Every private
family should consider itself a little state, in which the
several members ought to be united by one common
interest. Quarrels with each other are as fatal to their
welfare, as factions are dangerous to the peace of the
commonwealth. But indeed the necessity of union
and friendship extends itself to all kinds of relations
in life, and they conduce mightily to the advantage of
those who cherish and cultivate them. No enemy will
dare to attack a body of men firmly attached to each
other, and will fear to offend one of the number, lest
he should incur the resentment of the rest; but if
they split into parties, and are disunited by quarrels,
every petty opponent will venture to attack them, and
the whole fraternity will be liable to wrongs and violence.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Lion and a Tiger, at the same instant seized on
a young Fawn, which they immediately killed. This
they had no sooner performed, than they fell to fighting,
in order to decide whose property it should be.
The battle was so obstinate, that they were both compelled,
by weariness and loss of blood, to desist and
lie down breathless and quite disabled. A Wolf
passing that way, perceiving how the case stood, very
impudently stepped up and seized the booty, which
they had all this while been contending for, and carried
it off. The two combatants, who beheld this without
being able to prevent it, could only make this reflection:
How foolish, said they, has been our conduct!
Instead of being contented, as we ought, with our respective
shares, our senseless rage has rendered us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
unable to prevent this rascally Wolf from robbing us
of the whole.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> people go to law about an uncertain title,
and have spent the value of their whole estate in the
contest, nothing is more common than to find that
some unprincipled attorney has secured the object in
dispute to himself. The very name of law seems to
imply equity and justice, and that is the bait which
has drawn in many to their ruin. If we would lay
aside passion, prejudice, and folly, and think calmly of
the matter, we should find that going to law is not
the best way of deciding differences about property; it
being, generally speaking, much safer to trust to the
arbitration of two or three honest sensible neighbours,
than at a vast expence of money, time, and trouble,
to run through the tedious frivolous forms, with which,
by the artifices of greedy lawyers, a court of judicature
is contrived to be attended. Or if a case should
happen to be so intricate that a man of common sense
cannot distinguish who has the best title, how easy
would it be to have the opinion of the best counsel in
the land, and agree to abide by his decision. If it
should appear dubious, even after that, how much
better would it be to divide the thing in dispute, rather
than go to law, and hazard the losing, not only of the
whole, but costs and damages into the bargain!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Fox being caught in a trap, escaped after much
difficulty with the loss of his tail. He was, however,
a good deal ashamed of appearing in public without
this ornament, and at last, to avoid being singular and
ridiculous in the eyes of his own species, he formed
the project of calling together an assembly of Foxes,
and of persuading them that the docking of their tails
was a fashion that would be very agreeable and becoming.
Accordingly he made a long harangue to
them for that purpose, and endeavoured chiefly to
shew the awkwardness and inconvenience of a Fox’s
tail, adding that they were quite useless, and that they
would be a very great deal better without them. He
asserted, that what he had only conjectured and imagined
before, he now found by experience to be true,
for he never enjoyed himself so much, and found himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
so easy as he had done since he cut off his tail. He
then looked round with a brisk air, to see what proselytes
he had gained; when a sly old Fox in company
answered him, with a leer: I believe you may have
found a convenience in parting with your tail, and
perhaps when we are in the same circumstances, we
may do so too.</p>

deformity in the person of the inventor. Projectors
and planners of a higher stamp are also not uncommon
in the world. These men appear to toil only for the
public good, and the sacred name of patriotism is their
shield. It, however, often happens that when their
deep schemes are opened out, they are found to proceed
from nothing better than self-interested motives,
and a sincere desire to serve themselves.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> certain Miser, having got together a large sum

dug a hole and hid it. His greatest pleasure was to
go and look upon his treasure; which one of his servants
observing, and guessing there was something
more than ordinary in the place, came at night, found
the hoard, and carried it off. The next day, the
Miser returning as usual to the scene of his delight,
and perceiving the money gone, tore his hair for grief,
and uttered the most doleful accents of despair. A
neighbour, who knew his temper, overhearing him,
said, Cheer up, man! thou hast lost nothing: there
is still a hole to peep at: and if thou canst but fancy
the money there, it will do just as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Of</span> all the appetites to which human nature is subject,
none is so lasting, so strong, and so unaccountable,
as avarice. Other desires generally cool at the
approach of old age; but this flourishes under grey
hairs, and triumphs amidst infirmities. All our other
longings have something to be said in excuse for them;
but it is above reason, and therefore truly incomprehensible,
why a man should be passionately fond of
money only for the sake of gazing upon it. His treasure
is as useless to him as a heap of oyster shells; for
though he knows how many substantial pleasures it
might procure, yet he dares not touch it, and is as
destitute, to all intents and purposes, as the man who
is not worth a groat. This is the true state of a covetous
person, to which one of that fraternity perhaps
may reply, that when we have said all, since pleasure
is the grand aim of life, if there arise a delight to some,
from the bare possession of riches, though they do not
use, or even intend to use them, we may be puzzled
how to account for it, and think it strange, but ought
not absolutely to condemn those who thus closely, but
innocently, pursue what they esteem the greatest happiness.
True! people would be in the wrong to paint
covetousness in such odious colours, were it compatible
with innocence. But here arises the mischief: a covetous
man will stop at nothing to attain his ends; and
when once avarice takes the field, honesty, charity,
humanity, and every virtue which opposes it, are sure
to be put to the rout.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> young saucy Dog, having been found not to like
any employment at home, was taken by a sea captain
on board his ship, where, being well fed, he soon became
both stout and fierce, and shewed himself off as
such in every foreign port. He no sooner got ashore,
than he held up his leg against every post and corner,
and scraped the ground with his feet, quite regardless
what dog he might bespatter; and if any of them happened
to look sulkily at him, he thought nothing of
seizing upon and rolling them in the kennel. If he
happened to fall into company, he always began to
give himself airs, to talk big, and to express his contempt
for the dogs of the place. He would boast that
he was from a better country, and belonged to a better
family than any dog among them. In short, said he,
“I come from Cheviot, the highest mountain in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
world, and the very heart of all England, where my
forefathers, thousands of years ago, assembled to hunt
the Wild Bull, the Wolf, and the Boar.” He was
once going on at this rate, when he was interrupted
by a sedate, experienced Bitch, who assured him that
there were good dogs and bad dogs in every country,
and that the only difference arose from their education;
that many of the forefathers he boasted of, had
long since worried each other, and the remainder of
them had become so troublesome, that part had been
transported across the sea to another place; and she
knew, from good authority, that both his father and
his mother were hanged.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> foreigners speak slightingly of the country
they happen to be in, and praise their own, it shews in
them a want of good sense and good breeding. It is
indeed natural to have an affection for one’s native
land, nor can we help preferring it to every other; but
to express this in another country, to people whose opinion
it must needs contradict, by the same rule that it
is conformable to our own, cannot fail of giving them
just offence. It matters not how highly some particular
countries may stand in the estimation of the rest of the
world: this has little to do with private individuals;
the advantage of having been born in one of those favoured
countries, is accidental, and no man ought to
be esteemed merely on that account. In order to merit
the respect of virtuous and wise men in every foreign
land, it must appear to them that by our talents, our

country which gave us birth.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> man is known by his words, as a tree is by the

qualities of any one, let him but discourse, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
will speak them to us better than another can describe
them. We may therefore perceive, from this Fable,
how proper it is for those to hold their tongues, who
would not discover the shallowness of their understandings.
“Empty vessels make the greatest sound,” and
the deepest rivers are most silent; the greatest noise
is ever found where there is the least depth of water.
It is a true observation, that those who are the weakest
in understanding, and most slow of apprehension, are
generally the most precipitate in uttering their crude
conceptions. Grave looks, an aspect of dignity, and a
solemn deportment, may sometimes deceive even an accurate
observer; but wise discourse cannot be successfully
counterfeited or assumed, and the sententious
blockhead is as easily recognised as the pert coxcomb.

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE CAT AND THE FOX.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">As</span> the Cat and the Fox were once talking politics
together, in the middle of a forest, Reynard said, let
things turn out ever so bad, he did not care, for he
had a thousand tricks for them yet, before they should
hurt him; but pray, says he, Mrs Puss, suppose there
should be an invasion, what course do you design to
take? Nay, says the Cat, I have but one shift for it,
and if that won’t do, I am undone. I am sorry for
you, replies Reynard, with all my heart, and would
gladly furnish you with one or two of mine; but indeed
neighbour, as times go, it is not good to trust,
we must even be every one for himself, as the saying
is, and so your humble servant. These words were
scarcely out of his mouth, when they were alarmed
with a pack of hounds, that came upon them in full cry.
The Cat, by the help of her single shift, ran up a tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
and sat securely among the branches, whence she beheld
Reynard, who had not been able to get out of
sight, overtaken with his thousand tricks, and torn into
as many pieces by the Dogs, which had surrounded
him.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">One</span> good discreet expedient made use of upon an
emergency, will do a man more real service, and make
others think better of him, than to have passed all his
life for a shrewd crafty fellow, full of his stratagems
and expedients, and valuing himself upon his having
a deeper knowledge of the world than his neighbours.
Plain good sense, and a downright honest meaning,
are a better guide through life, and more trusty security
against danger, than the low shifts of cunning,
and the refinements of artifice. Cunning is of a deep
entangling nature, and is a sign of a small genius;
though when it happens to be successful, it often makes
an ostentatious pretension to wisdom; but simplicity
of manners is the ally of integrity, and plain common
sense is the main requisite of wisdom.</p>

his Dog thought this a fit opportunity to invite
another Dog, an intimate of his own, to partake with
him of the good cheer, in the kitchen. Accordingly the
stranger punctually attended, and seeing the mighty
preparations going forward, promised himself a most
delicious repast. He began to smell about, and, with
his eyes intent upon the victuals, to lick his lips, and
wag his tail. This drew the attention of the Cook,
who stole slyly up, and seizing him by the hind legs,
whirled him out of the window into the street. The
Dog, stunned and hurt by his hard fall on the pavement,
began to howl, the noise of which drew several
Dogs about him, who knowing of the invitation, began
to enquire how he had fared? O! charmingly,
said he; only I ate and drank till I scarce knew which
way I came out of the house.</p>

the great men themselves are but too apt to deceive

the Tiger resumed courage, and bidding them not be
afraid, said that he alone would engage the enemy,
telling them they might depend on his valour to avenge
their wrongs. In the midst of these threats,
while he was lashing himself with his tail, and tearing
up the ground with anger, an arrow pierced his ribs,
and hung by its barbed point in his side. He set up
a loud and hideous roar, occasioned by the anguish
he felt, and endeavoured to draw out the painful dart
with his teeth: when the Fox approaching him, enquired
with an air of surprise, who it was that could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
have strength and courage enough to wound so mighty
and valorous a beast? Ah! says the Tiger, I was

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Though</span> strength and courage are very good ingredients
towards making us secure and formidable in the
world, yet unless there be a proper portion of wisdom
or policy to direct them, instead of being serviceable,
they often prove detrimental to their proprietors. A
rash forward man, who depends upon the excellence
of his own parts and accomplishments, is likewise apt
to expose a weak side, which his enemies might not
otherwise have observed; and gives an advantage to
others by those very means which he fancied might
have secured it to himself. Counsel and conduct always
did and always will govern the world; and the
strong, in spite of all their force, can never avoid being
tools to the crafty. Some men are as much superior
to others in wisdom and policy, as man in general
is above the brute. Strength, ill-governed, opposed
to them, is like a quarter staff in the hands of a huge,
robust, but bungling fellow, who fights against a
master of the science. The latter, though without a
weapon, would have skill and address enough to disarm
his adversary, and drub him with his own staff.
In a word, savage fierceness and brutal strength, must
not pretend to stand in competition with policy and
stratagem.</p>

the head of the actor, who not seldom, from a deep

their brains!” There is no vice which gains an ascendant
over us more insensibly, or more incurably,
than drunkenness: it takes root by degrees, and comes
at length to be past both remedy and shame. Habitual
drunkenness stupifies the senses, destroys the understanding,
fills its votaries with diseases, and makes
them incapable of business. It cuts short the thread
of life, or brings on an early old age, besides the mischief
it does in the mean time to a man’s family and
affairs, and the scandal it brings upon himself: for a
sot is one of the most despicable and disgusting characters
in life. After he has destroyed his reasoning
faculties, and thus shewn his ingratitude to the giver
of them, he flies to palliatives as a remedy for the diseases
which his intemperance has caused, and goes on

thought Foxes were as happy in that respect as almost
any other creatures; for they bred constantly once
a year, if not oftener, and always had a good litter of
cubs at every birth; and yet, says she, there are some
folks who are never delivered of more than one at
a time, and that perhaps not above once or twice in
their whole lives, who hold up their noses, and value
themselves so much upon it, that they think all other
creatures beneath them, and scarce worthy to be spoken

bring forth an offspring whom they neither cherish nor
provide for. Such a description of persons are not fit
to become parents, and they must not be surprized, if
their want of parental affection produce a corresponding
want of filial attachment and respect: for the duties
between parents and children are reciprocal. It is
the goodness of parents which chiefly entitles them to
the respect due to that name; and it is a paramount
duty of children to honour, obey, and revere such
parents as fulfil the obligations which the laws of God

never have any dealings with bad men, even to do
them kindnesses. Men of evil principles are a generation
of vipers, that ought to be crushed; and every
rogue should be looked upon by honest men as a venomous
serpent. The man who is occasionally, or by accident,
one’s enemy, may be mollified by kindness, and
reclaimed by good usage: such a behaviour both reason

resolve, if not to suppress, at least to have no connexion

habitual villainy, and their nature leavened with

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Porcupine, wanting a shelter for himself, begged
a nest of Snakes to give him admittance into their snug
cave. They were prevailed upon, and let him in accordingly;
but were so annoyed with his sharp prickly
quills, that they soon repented of their easy compliance,
and intreated the Porcupine to withdraw, and
leave them their hole to themselves. No, said he, let
them quit the place that dont like it; for my part, I
am well enough satisfied as I am.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable points out the danger of entering into
any degree of friendship, alliance, or partnership with
any person whatever, before we have thoroughly considered
his nature and qualities, his circumstances, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
his humour; and also the necessity of examining our
own temper and disposition, to discover, if we can,
how far these may accord with the genius of those with
whom we are about to form a connection; otherwise
our associations, of whatever kind they be, may prove
the greatest plague of our life. Young people, who
are warm in all their passions, and suffer them, like a
veil, to hoodwink their reason, often throw open their
arms at once, and admit into the greatest intimacy
persons whom they know little of, but by false and uncertain
lights, and thus, perhaps, take a Porcupine
into their bosom, instead of an inmate who might
sooth the cares of life, as an amiable consort, or a
valuable friend.</p>

knew not how to come at it. So, under the pretence
of a friendly visit, he gave her a call, and endeavoured
to insinuate himself into her good graces by his
apparently kind enquiries after the welfare of herself

for a little fresh air, you may depend upon my taking
as much care of your young family as you could do

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> an entire stranger, or any one of whom we

it is dangerous to have the least connection, and with
whom any commerce or correspondence will certainly
be to our detriment. From these we should,
therefore, resolve not to accept even favours, but carefully
avoid being under any obligation to them: for
in the end, their apparent kindness will shew itself to
be a real injury; and there is no method of guarding

avoiding their society, or shutting our doors against
them, as we would do against a thief.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> antient times, the nation of Frogs lived an easy
free life among their lakes and ponds; but at length
grew dissatisfied with such a continuance of undisturbed
tranquillity, and petitioned Jupiter for a king.
Jupiter smiled at their folly, and threw them down a
log of wood, and with a thundering voice said, “there
is a king for you.” With this, and the sudden splash
it made in the water, they were at first quite panic-struck,
and for some time durst not put their heads
up; but by degrees they ventured to take a peep, and
at length even to leap upon the log. Not being pleased
with so tame and insipid a king, they again petitioned
Jupiter for another, who would exert more authority.
Jupiter, disgusted at their importunate folly, sent them
a Stork for their king, who, without ceremony, eat
them up whenever his craving appetite required a supply.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable is said to have been spoken by Æsop
to the Athenians, who had flourished under their commonwealth,
and lived under good and wholesome laws
of their own enacting, until, in process of time, they
suffered their liberty to run into licentiousness; and
factious designing men fomented divisions, and raised
animosities among them. When thus rendered weak,
Pisistratus took the advantage, and seized upon their
citadel and liberties both together. The Athenians
finding themselves in a state of slavery, though their
tyrant happened to be a merciful one, could not bear
the thoughts of it; but Æsop in reciting the Fable to
them, prescribes patience where there was no other remedy,
and adds, at last, “Wherefore, my dear countrymen,
be contented with your present condition, bad
as it is, for fear a change should make it worse.”</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Phædrus</span> was an old man when he wrote his Fables,

melancholy idea that is given us by the intercourse
with elderly persons, whose conversation is relishing
and agreeable, and we cannot help concluding that
they must have been very engaging in the prime of life,
when in their decline they are still capable of yielding
us so much pleasure. Nor can we help feeling regret,
that this fountain of delight is now almost dried up,
and going to forsake us for ever. On the contrary,
when people have neglected to cultivate their minds in
youth, their whole deportment through life is marked
with the effects of this great want, and their old age is
burthensome to themselves, and their conversation insipid
to others; and like liquor of a thin body, and

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Camel presented a petition to Jupiter, complaining
of the hardships of his case, in not having,
like bulls and other creatures, horns, or any weapon
of defence to protect himself from the attacks of his
enemies; and praying that relief might be granted him
in such manner as should be thought most expedient.
Jupiter could not help smiling at his impertinent address;
but, however, rejected the petition, and told
him, that so far from granting his unreasonable request,
he would take care that henceforward his ears
should be shortened, as a punishment for his presumptuous
importunity.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> nature of things is so fixed in every particular,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
that they are very weak, superstitious people, who
think that it can be altered. But besides the impossibility
of producing a change by foolish importunities,
they who employ much of their time in that way, instead
of getting, are sure to lose in the end. When
any man is so silly and vexatious as to make unreasonable
complaints, and to harbour undue repinings in his
heart, his peevishness will lessen the real good which
he possesses, and the sourness of his temper shorten
that allowance of comfort which he already thinks too
scanty. Thus, in truth, it is not Providence, but ourselves,
who punish our own importunity, in soliciting
for impossibilities, with a sharp corroding care, which
abridges us of some part of that little pleasure which
Heaven has cast into our lot.</p>

Pray what is the reason that you, who are so

Stag, though I know not how to account for it: I am

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> tall Fir, that stood towering up in the forest, was
so proud of his dignity and high station, that he looked
with disdain upon the little shrubs that grew beneath
him. A lowly Bramble had often been made to feel
the insults and gloomy frowns of his lofty neighbour,
who, on the slightest rufflings of the winds, shook his
extended arms over the humble shrub, and upbraided
him with his contemptible situation. As for me, said
the Fir, I am the first in the forest for beauty and
rank: my top shoots up into the clouds, and my
branches display a perpetual verdure, whilst you lie
grovelling upon the ground, and could not live were
I to leave off sprinkling you with the drops from my
extremities. At this the Bramble set up his prickles,
and replied, that this haughtiness arose from pride and
ignorance; for He that made thee a lofty tree, could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
with equal ease, have made thee an humble Bramble;
and high as thou art, a puff of His breath, in the message
of a north wind, can rob thee of thy verdure, or
lay thee low; and further, I pray thee tell me, when
the woodman comes with his axe to fell timber, whether
thou wouldst not rather be a Bramble than a Fir?</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Pride,</span> which was implanted in the human breast
for wise purposes, should carefully be directed aright.
It was intended only to exalt the minds of all ranks
and conditions of men, to that pitch, which will make
them spurn at, and despise the doing of a mean or dishonourable
action; and it is only misapplied, when it
puffs up those whom fortune has placed in high stations,
or overloaded with riches, and tempts them to
look down with derision on those below them. The
higher a man is exalted in life, but especially if he have
risen by dishonourable means, the more unlikely it is
that he will escape a storm, or the mischiefs to which
he may be exposed in his public capacity, in any convulsion
that may befal his country. When public justice
overtakes him, and he finds the day of reckoning
near at hand, the honest monitor within will put him
in mind of his true situation, and he will then be enabled
to make a just comparison between his own lofty
station, and that of the poor, but honest, man.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> number of Drones, who had long lived at their
ease in a hive of Bees, without contributing by their
labour to make any honey, at length began to dispute
the right of the Bees, and insisted that both
the honey and the combs were their property. The
Bees, after much altercation, at last offered to leave
the dispute to reference, and this being assented to by
the Drones, the Wasp was chosen umpire. Accordingly,
he began by declaring, that as both parties, he
hoped, were his friends, and he wished them well, he
would instantly proceed upon the investigation. I
must own, says he, that the point is somewhat dubious,
for I have often seen you both in the same
hive, and excepting that the Drones are of a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
portly size and appearance, you are all otherwise nearly
alike in person: but as I have not been able to see
who worked, and who did not, I know of no mode
in which I shall be enabled to judge so correctly, as
by setting each party to work at the making of the
honey. Therefore, addressing himself to the Bees,
you take one hive; and you, speaking to the Drones,
will be so good as to take another, and both go to
work to make honey as fast as you can. The Bees
readily accepted the proposal; but the Drones hung
back, and would not agree to it. So, so! says Judge
Wasp, I see clearly how the matter stands; and without
further ceremony, declared in favour of the Bees.</p>

well conclude that their pretensions are unfounded, and
that they are mere impostors. When men, who are at
the head of national affairs, will not be at the pains to
find out merit (for men of that character are too modest
to obtrude themselves) they will be surrounded by a
swarm of idle, impudent, good-for-nothing drones;
and these too often succeed in obtaining those benefits
which should be the reward of men of parts, integrity,

made the beasts admire his learning, and give

ourselves. Good advice ought always to be followed,
without our being prejudiced upon account of the person

be brought to think us worth minding, when we prescribe
cures for maladies with which we ourselves are
afflicted. Physician heal thyself, is too scriptural, not
to be applied upon such an occasion; and if we would
avoid being the jest of an audience, we must be sound
and free from those diseases of which we would endeavour
to cure others. How shocked must people have
been to hear a preacher for a whole hour declaim
against drunkenness, when his own weaknesses have
been such, that he could neither bear nor forbear
drinking, and perhaps was the only person in the congregation
who made the doctrine at that time necessary!
Others, too, have been very zealous in censuring
crimes, of which none were suspected more than
themselves: but let such silly hypocrites remember,

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> Oak, which hung over the bank of a river, was
blown down by a violent storm of wind, and as it was
carried along by the stream, some of its boughs brushed
against a Reed which grew near the shore. This
struck the Oak with a thought of admiration, and he
could not forbear asking the Reed how he came to
stand so secure and unhurt, in a tempest which had
been furious enough to tear up an Oak by the roots?
Why, says the Reed, I secure myself by a conduct the
reverse of yours: instead of being stubborn and stiff,
and confiding in my strength, I yield and bend to
the blast, and let it go over me, knowing how vain
and fruitless it would be to resist.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Though</span> a tame submission to injuries which it is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
our power to redress, be generally esteemed a base and
dishonourable thing, yet to resist where there is no
probability, or even hope of getting the better, may
also be looked upon as the effect of a blind temerity,
and perhaps of a weak understanding. The strokes of
fortune are oftentimes as irresistible as they are severe,
and he who with an impatient spirit fights against her,
instead of alleviating, does but double the blows upon
himself. A person of a quiet still temper, whether it
be given him by nature, or acquired by art, calmly
composes himself in the midst of a storm, so as to elude
the shock, or receive it with the least detriment,—like a
prudent experienced sailor, who, in swimming to the
shore from a wrecked vessel, in a swelling sea, does not
oppose the fury of the waves, but stoops and gives way,
that they may roll over his head without obstruction.
The doctrine of absolute submission in all cases, is an
absurd dogmatical precept, with nothing but ignorance
and superstition to support it; but, upon particular occasions,
and where it is impossible for us to overcome,
to submit patiently is one of the most reasonable maxims
of life.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Wolf, after devouring his prey, happened to have
a bone stick in his throat, which gave him so much
pain, that he went howling up and down, and importuning
every creature he met to lend him a kind hand

reward to any one who should perform the operation
with success. At last, the Crane undertook the business,
ventured his long neck into the rapacious felon’s
throat, plucked out the bone, and asked for the promised
reward. The Wolf, turning his eyes disdainfully
towards him, said, I did not think you had been
so unconscionable: I had your head in my mouth, and
could have bit it off whenever I pleased, but suffered
you to take it away without any damage, and yet you

<p><span class="firstword">There</span> are people in the world to whom it may be
wrong to do services, upon a double score: first, because
they never deserve to have a good office done
them; and secondly, because when once engaged, it is
so hard a matter to get well rid of their acquaintance.
We ought to consider what kind of people they are,
to whom we are desired to do good offices, before we
do them: for he that grants a favour, or even confides
in a person of no honour, instead of finding his account
in it, comes off well, if he be no sufferer in the end.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE HART AND THE VINE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Hart being closely pursued by the Hunters, concealed
himself under the broad leaves of a shady Vine.
When the Hunters were gone by, and had given him
over for lost, he thinking himself very secure, began
to crop and eat the leaves of his shelter. By this, the
branches being put into a rustling motion drew the attention
of some of the Hunters that way, who seeing
the Vine stir, and fancying some wild beast had taken
covert there, shot their arrows at a venture, and killed
the Deer. Before he expired, he uttered his dying
words to this purpose: “Ah!” says he, “I suffer
justly for my ingratitude; because I could not forbear
doing an injury to the Vine, which so kindly concealed
me in time of danger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">There</span> is no maxim which deserves more frequent
repetition, and if the heart be capable of amendment
by precept and admonition, no virtue should be more
strongly enforced and recommended than gratitude.
Where sentiments of this kind are wanting, our natures
soon become debased, and our minds depraved.
Ingratitude has ever been justly branded as the blackest
of crimes, and, as it were, comprehending all other
vices within it. Nor can we say that this opinion is
too severe: for if a man be capable of injuring his
benefactor, what will he scruple doing towards another?
We may fairly conclude that he who is guilty
of ingratitude, will not hesitate at any other crime of
an inferior nature. Since there are no human laws to
punish this infamous prevailing vice, it would only
be doing an act of justice, and supplying the want, to
point out criminals of this description to the reprobation
of mankind, that men of worth might avoid all intercourse
and communication with them. The ingrate
should also bear in mind, that he strips himself of the
protection which might have been afforded by his
friends, and exposes himself to the shafts of his enemies,
who will not fail to take advantage of the defenceless
state to which his folly and depravity have reduced
him.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is in vain for individuals to contend against an
overwhelming power, and an ineffectual resistance to
violence only tends to double our sufferings. When
life is pursued, and in danger, whoever values it should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
give up every thing but his honour to preserve it; and
there can be no disgrace in yielding voluntarily to our
persecutors, when we are certain that resistance is in

are making their wicked strides over a country (as has
sometimes happened even in Europe) the people would
seldom fail to rid themselves of their oppressors, if they
resolved to rise as one man, and bravely oppose them.</p>

of the beasts upon which he preyed, and so scared

He invited the Ass to assist him in his plan, and gave
him instructions how to act. Go, said the Lion, and
hide thyself in yonder thicket, and then let me hear
thee bray in the most frightful manner thou possibly
canst. The stratagem took effect accordingly. The Ass
brayed most hideously, and the timorous beasts, not
knowing what to think of it, began to scour off as fast
as they could; when the Lion, who was posted at a
proper avenue, seized and killed them as he pleased.
Having got his belly full, he called out to the Ass, and
bade him leave off, telling him he had done enough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
Upon this, the long-eared brute came out of his ambush,
and approaching the Lion, asked him, with an
air of conceit, how he liked his performance? Prodigiously!
says he, you did it so well, that I protest
had I not known your nature and temper, I might

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE SATYR AND THE TRAVELLER.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Satyr, as he was ranging the forest in an exceeding
cold snowy season, met with a Traveller half-starved
with the extremity of the weather. He took
compassion on him, and kindly invited him home to a
warm cave he had in the hollow of a rock. As soon as
they had entered and sat down, notwithstanding there
was a good fire in the place, the chilly Traveller could
not forbear blowing his fingers. Upon the Satyr asking
him why he did so? He answered, that he did it to
warm his hands. The honest Sylvan having seen little
of the world, admired a man who was master of so valuable
a quality as that of blowing heat; and therefore
resolved to entertain him in the best manner he could.
He spread the table with dried fruits of several sorts,
and produced a remnant of old cordial wine, which he
mulled with some warm spices over the fire, and presented
to his shivering guest. But this the Traveller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
thought fit to blow upon likewise; and when the Satyr
demanded a reason why he did so, he replied, to
cool his dish. This second answer provoked the Satyr’s
indignation as much as the first had kindled his
surprise; so, taking the man by the shoulders, he
thrust him out of the place, saying, he would have nothing
to do with a wretch who had so vile a quality as
to blow hot and cold with the same breath.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Nothing</span> can be more offensive to a man of a sincere
honest heart, than he who blows with different
breaths from the same mouth: who flatters a man to
his face, and reviles him behind his back. Such double-dealing
false friends ought and will always be considered
as unworthy of being treated otherwise than as
worthless and disagreeable persons: for unless the
tenor of a man’s life be always true and consistent with
itself, the less one has to do with him the better. It
is unfortunately too common with persons of this cast
of character, in the exalted stations of life, to serve a
present view, or perhaps only the caprice or whim of
the moment, to blow nothing but what is warm, benevolent,
and cherishing, to raise up the expectations of
a dependent to the highest degree; and when they suspect
he may prove troublesome, they then, by a sudden
cold forbidding air, easily blast all his hopes and expectations:
but such a temper, whether it proceed from
a designed or natural levity, is detestable, and has been
the cause of much trouble and mortification to many a
brave deserving man.</p>

mankind to this temper, and there is a numerous class of

all the stars and garters, and collars of an illustrious

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable is levelled at those who love to “fish

are such, that they care not what mischief or what
confusion they occasion in the world, provided they
can obtain their ends, or even gratify some little selfish
appetite. Little villains would set fire to a town, provided
they could rake something of value to themselves
out of its ashes; or kindle the flames of discord among
friends and neighbours, purely to gratify their own
malicious temper; and among the great ones there are
those who, to succeed in their ambitious designs, will
make no scruple of involving their country in divisions
and animosities at home, and sometimes in war
and bloodshed abroad: provided they do but maintain
themselves in power, they care not what havoc and
desolation they bring upon the rest of mankind. Their
only reason is, that it must be so, because they cannot
live as they wish without it. But brutish unsocial sentiments
like these, are such as a mere state of nature
would scarcely suggest; and it is perverting the very
end, and overturning the first principles of society,
when, instead of contributing to the welfare of mankind,
in return for the benefits we receive from them,
we thrive by their misfortunes, or subsist by their
ruin. Those, therefore, who have the happiness of
mankind at heart, (for happiness and morality are inseparably
connected) should enter their protest against
such wicked selfish notions, and oppose them with all

you ought to know, Master Reynard, that we should

a good thing always to be prepared against the worst

governments know that they cannot be safe in
peace, unless they are always prepared for war, and
are ready to meet the worst that can happen. When
they become corrupt, or supine, and off their guard,
they thereby invite and expose their country to the
sudden attacks of its enemies. In private life, many
evils and calamities befal those who make no provision
against unforeseen or untoward accidents, which the
prudent man prevents by looking forward to probable
contingencies, and having a reserve of every thing
necessary before-hand,—that he may not be put into
hurry and confusion, nor thrown into dilemmas and
difficulties, when the time comes that he may have to
encounter them. It cannot be too strongly impressed
upon the minds of all men, that day by day they are
approaching towards old age, and that they should
honourably endeavour to provide a store of conveniences
against that time, when they will be most in
want of them, and least able to procure them. To
reflect properly upon this, will give them pleasure instead
of pain; and they will not die a day sooner for
being always ready for that certain event: to do otherwise

better elsewhere; and therefore I must tell you, that

labouring under a voluntary necessity, and taking

good; who, by a complaisance wrong judged or ill applied,
displease whilst they endeavour to oblige, and
are never doing less to the purpose than when they are
most employed. In a word, this Fable is designed for
the reformation of all those who endeavour to gain for
themselves benefits and applause, from a misapplied
industry. It is not our being busy and officious that
will procure us the esteem of men of sense; but the
application of our actions to some noble useful purpose,
and for the general good of mankind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE FROGS AND THE FIGHTING BULLS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Frog, one day, peeping out of the lake, and looking
about him, saw two Bulls fighting at some distance
off in the meadow, and calling to his associates, Look,
says he, what dreadful work is yonder! Dear sirs,
what will become of us? Tush, said one of his companions,
do not frighten yourself so about nothing;
how can their quarrels affect us? They are of a different
kind, and are at present only contending which
shall be master of the herd. That is true, replies the
first, their quality and station in life are different from
ours; but as one of them will certainly prove conqueror,
he that is worsted, being beaten out of the meadow,
will take refuge here in the marshes, and possibly tread
some of us to death; so you see we are more nearly
concerned in this dispute of theirs, than you were at
first aware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> wise man, however low his condition in life, looks
forward through the proper and natural course and
connection of causes and effects; and in so doing, he
fortifies his mind against the worst that can befal him.
It is of no small importance to the honest and quiet
part of mankind, who desire nothing so much as to see
peace and virtue flourish, to consider well the consequences
that may arise to them out of the quarrels and
feuds of the great, and to endeavour, by every means
in their power, to avoid being in any way drawn in by
their influence to become a party concerned in their
broils and disputes: for no matter in which way the
strife between the high contending parties may terminate,
those who may have had the misfortune to be
concerned with them, ought to think themselves well off
if they do not smart for it severely in the end. How
often has it happened, that men in eminent stations,
who want to engross all power into their own hands,
begin, under the mask of patriotism, to foment divisions
and form factions, and excite animosities between
well-meaning, but undiscerning people, without whose
aid in one way or another they could not succeed; but
who, at the same time, little think that the great aim
of their leaders is nothing more than the advancement
of their own private interest, or ambitious ends. The
good of the public is always pretended upon such occasions,
and may sometimes happen to be tacked to their
own; but then it is purely accidental, and never was
originally intended.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> Old Hound, who had excelled in his time, and

last, through age, became feeble and unserviceable.
However, being in the field one day, when the Stag
was almost run down, he happened to be the first that
came in with him, and seized him by the haunch; but
his decayed and broken teeth not being able to keep
their hold, the Deer escaped; upon which, his Master
fell into a great passion, and began to whip him severely.
The honest old creature is said to have barked
out this apology: Ah! do not thus strike your poor
old servant: it is not my heart and inclination, but my
strength and speed, that fail me. If what I now am
displease you, pray do not forget what I have been!</p>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable is intended to reprove the ingratitude

the prime of his life in our service for a bare subsistence.
Where slavery is allowed, the laws compel the
master to provide for the worn-out slave; and where
there is no law to enforce the debt of gratitude, none
but those who are insensible to all the finer feelings of
humanity will neglect it. Those who forget past services,
and treat their faithful servants or friends unkindly
or injuriously, when they are no longer of use
to them, however high their pride, are unworthy of
the name of gentleman. They are, indeed, commonly
of an upstart breed, with whom the failure of human
nature itself is imputed as a crime; and servants and
dependents, instead of being considered their fellow-men,
are treated like brutes for not being more than
men. The imprudence of this conduct is equal to its
wickedness, inasmuch as it directly tends to extinguish
the honest desire to please and to act faithfully, in the
younger servants, when they see that worn-out merit
thus goes unrewarded. Humanity and gratitude are
the greatest ornaments of the human mind, and when
they are extinguished, every generous and noble sentiment
perishes along with them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE TWO BITCHES.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Bitch, who was just ready to whelp, intreated
another to lend her her kennel only till her month was
up, and assured her that then she should have it again.
The other very readily consented, and with a great
deal of civility, resigned it to her immediately. However,
when the time was elapsed, she came and made
her a visit, and very modestly intimated, that now she
was up and well, she hoped she should see her abroad
again; for that, really, it would be inconvenient for
her to be without her kennel any longer, and therefore,
she told her, she must be so free as to desire her
to provide herself with other lodgings as soon as she
could. The lying-in Bitch replied, that truly she was
ashamed of having kept her so long out of her own
house; but it was not upon her own account (for indeed
she was well enough to go any where) so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
as that of her puppies, who were yet so weak, that she
was afraid they would not be able to follow her; and,
if she would be so good as to let her stay a fortnight
longer, she would take it as the greatest obligation in
the world. The other Bitch was so good-natured and
compassionate as to comply with this request also; but
at the expiration of the term, came and told her positively
that she must turn out, for she could not possibly
let her be there a day longer. Must turn out,
says the other; we will see to that: for I promise you,
unless you can beat me and my whole litter of whelps,
you are never likely to have any thing more to do here.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Wise</span> and good-natured men do not shut their ears,
nor harden their hearts, against the calls of humanity,
and the cries of distress; but how often are their generous
natures imposed upon by the artifices of the base
and worthless! These fail not to lay their plans with
deep cunning, to work themselves into the good graces
of the benevolent, and having accomplished their ends,
the return they often make is abusive language, or the
most open acts of violence. One of the evil and lamentable
consequences arising out of this, is, that worth in
distress suffers by it: for distrust and suspicion take
hold of the minds of good men, and the hand of charity
is thus benumbed. This Fable may also serve to caution
us never to let any thing we value go out of our
possession without good security. The man who means
to act prudently, ought never to put himself in the
power of others, or to run any risk of involving his
own family in ruin.</p>

I heard that you were ill, and kept within; at which I
was so concerned, that I could not rest till I came to
see you. Pray how is it with you now? Let me feel
your pulse a little: indeed you do not look well at all.
He was running on after this fulsome manner, when
the Hen answered him from the roost, Truly, friend
Reynard, you are judging rightly, for I never was in
more pain in my life: I must beg your pardon for
being so free as to tell you that I see no company;
and you must excuse me too for not coming down to
you, for, to say the truth, my condition is such, that
I fear I should catch my death by it.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is generally the design of hypocritical persons to
delude and impose upon others, with an eye to derive
some benefit to themselves, when they pretend to
feel a flattering anxiety for their welfare; or sometimes
they may perhaps, with impertinent folly, mean no
more than merely to mock and befool men who are
weak enough to become their dupes. In both cases
they are enemies to truth and sincerity, which adorn
and tend so greatly to promote the happiness of society,
and they ought to be exposed as such. For although
men of penetration see through the pretence,
and escape its dangers, yet the weak, the vain, and the
unsuspicious are put off their guard, and have not discernment
enough to shun the trap so pleasingly baited.
The Fable also furnishes a hint against hypocritical,
legacy hunters, whose regard is generally of the same
nature as that of the Fox for the Hen.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> Ass, while feeding upon the coarse herbage by
the edge of a wood, found a Lion’s skin, and putting
it on, went in this disguise into the adjoining forests
and pastures, and threw all the flocks and herds into
the greatest consternation and dismay. At length, his
master, who was in search of him, made his appearance,
and the silly beast, entertaining the idea of
frightening him also, capered forward with a terrific
gait towards him; but the good man seeing his long
ears stick out, presently knew him, and with a stout
cudgel made him sensible, that notwithstanding his being
dressed in a Lion’s skin, he was really no more
than an Ass.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">As</span> all affectation is wrong, and tends to expose
and make a man ridiculous, so the more distant he is
from the thing which he affects to appear, the stronger
will be the ridicule which he excites, and the greater
the inconvenience into which he thereby runs himself.
How strangely absurd it is for a timorous person to
procure a military post, in order to keep himself out of
danger! and to fancy a red coat the surest protection
for cowardice! Yet there have been those who have
purchased a commission to avoid being insulted; and
have been so silly as to think courage was interwoven
with a sash, or tied up in a cockade. But it would
not be amiss for such gentlemen to consider that it is
not in the power of scarlet cloth to alter nature, and
that as it is expected a soldier should shew himself a
man of courage and intrepidity upon all proper occasions,
they may by this means meet the disgrace they
intended to avoid, and appear greater Asses than they
needed to have done. However, it is not in point of
fortitude only that people are liable to expose themselves,
by assuming a character to which they are not
equal; but he who puts on a shew of learning, of religion,
of a superior capacity in any respect, or in short,
of any virtue or knowledge, to which he has no proper
claim, is, and will always be found to be, an Ass in a
Lion’s skin.</p>

slapped his hand upon the place, with the intention of
crushing the assailant; but the little nimble insect
escaped between his fingers, and repeated its attacks.
Every time he struck at it, he gave himself a smart
blow upon the leg, but missed his aim. At this he became
enraged, and in the height of his peevish and
impatient humour, he earnestly prayed to Hercules,
beseeching him with his mighty power to stretch forth
his arm against a pernicious insect, by which he was
so miserably tormented.</p>

absurdly miserable on the most foolish occasion. His
good humour is soured in an instant, and he is rendered
uncomfortable to himself, and odious or ridiculous
to all about him. He prays with earnestness to the
Supreme Being to aid him in all his paltry selfish
schemes, or to gratify vanities, for which, as a rational
being, he ought to blush and be ashamed. The
imaginary distresses, which his unfortunate disposition
heightens into severe calamities, are matter of diversion
to those who are disposed to sneer at him; and
when his pettish humour makes him rave like a madman,
and curse his fate, at the dropping of a hat, or
the blunder of a servant, even his friends must view
his behaviour with a mixed emotion of pity and contempt.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">One</span> hot sultry day, a Wolf and a Lamb happened
to come just at the same time, to quench their thirst
in the stream of a brook that fell tumbling down the
side of a rocky mountain. The Wolf stood upon the
higher ground, and the Lamb at some distance below
him. However, the Wolf, having a mind to pick a
quarrel with the Lamb, asked him what he meant by
disturbing the water, and making it so muddy that he
could not drink? and, at the same time, demanded satisfaction.
The Lamb, frightened at this threatening
charge, told him, in a tone as mild as possible, that
with humble submission, he could not conceive how
that could be, since the water which he drank ran
down from the Wolf to him, and therefore could not
be disturbed so far up the stream. Be that as it
may, replies the Wolf, you are a rascal, and I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
been told that you used ill language concerning me behind
my back, about half a year ago. Upon my word,
says the Lamb, the time you mention was before I was
born. The Wolf, finding it to no purpose to argue
any longer against truth, fell into a great passion,
snarling and foaming at the mouth as if he had been
mad; and drawing nearer to the Lamb, Sirrah, says
he, if it were not you, it was your father, and that is
the same. So he seized the poor innocent helpless
thing, tore it to pieces, and made a meal of it.</p>

At last, a young Mouse, in a fine florid speech,
broached an expedient, which he contended was the
only one to put them entirely out of the power of the
enemy, and this was, that the Cat should wear a bell
about her neck, which, upon the least motion, would
give the alarm, and be a signal for them, to retire into
their holes. This speech was received with great applause,
and it was even proposed by some, that the
Mouse who had made it should have the thanks of the
assembly. Upon which, an old Mouse, who had sat
silent hitherto, gravely observed, that the contrivance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
was admirable, and the author of it, without doubt,
very ingenious; but he thought it would not be so proper
to vote him thanks, till he should further inform

neck, and who would undertake the task.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is easy for visionary projectors to devise schemes,

man of solid judgment can be prevailed upon to attempt
putting them into execution. In all matters
where the good of the community is at stake, new projects
should be carefully examined in all their bearings,
that the ruinous consequences which might follow them
may be avoided. All business of this import ought to
be left to the decision of such men only as are distinguished
for their good sense, probity, honour, and patriotism.
When these have examined them in all their
different bearings, we may place confidence in their
labours, and adopt their plans; but the Fable teaches
us not to listen to those rash and ignorant politicians,
who are always foisting their schemes upon the public
upon every occurrence of mal-administration, without

<p><span class="firstword">On</span> the death of the old Lion, without his leaving
an heir, the beasts assembled to choose another king
of the forest in his stead. The crown was tried on
many a head, but did not sit easy upon any one. At
length the Ape putting it upon his own, declared that
it fitted him quite well, and after shewing them many
antic tricks, he with a great deal of grimace, and an
affected air of wisdom, offered himself to fill the high
office. The silly creatures being pleased with him at
the moment, instantly, by a great majority, proclaimed
him king. The Fox, quite vexed to see his fellow-subjects
act so foolishly, resolved to convince them of
their sorry choice, and knowing of a trap ready baited,
at no great distance, he addressed himself to King
Ape, and told him that he had discovered a treasure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
which being found on the waste, belonged to his Majesty.
The Ape presently went to take possession of
the prize; but no sooner had he laid his paws upon the
bait, than he was caught fast in the trap. In this situation,
between shame and anger, he chattered out
many bitter reproaches against the Fox, calling him
rebel and traitor, and threatening revenge: to all which
Reynard gravely replied, that this was nothing but a
beginning of what he would meet with in the high station
his vanity had prompted him to aspire to, as it
was only one of the many traps that would be laid for
him, and in which he would be caught; but he hoped,
this one might be a treasure to him, if it operated as a
caution, and served to put him in mind of the false
estimate he had put upon his abilities, in supposing,
that with his inexperienced empty pate, he could manage
the weighty affairs of state. He then, with a
laugh, left him to be relieved from his peril by one or
other of his foolish loving subjects.</p>

self-conceit, aspire to any high station without the requisites

age, and the length of the way, he grew so faint and
weak, that he sunk under it, and as he sat upon the

ease him of his troubles. Death no sooner heard him,
than he came and demanded what he wanted? The
poor old Creature, who little thought Death was so

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable gives us a lively representation of the
general behaviour of mankind towards that grim king

him behind his back, that upon every little accident
which happens in their way, Death is immediately
called upon, and they even wish it might be lawful for
them to finish with their own hands a life so odious,
so perpetually tormenting, and vexatious. When, let
but Death make his appearance, and the very sense of
his near approach almost does the business: then it is
that they change their minds, and would be glad to
come off so well as to have their old burthen laid upon
their shoulders again. But wise and good men know
that care and numberless disappointments must be their
portion in their passage through life, and know also
that it is their duty to endure them with patience; for
he is the best and happiest man who neither wishes nor
fears the approach of Death.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Fox scrambling hastily over a hedge, in his flight
from the hounds, got his foot severely torn by a Briar.
Smarting with the pain, he burst into revilings and
complaints at this treatment, which he declared he
little expected to meet with for only passing over a
hedge; and he could not help thinking it was very bad
usage to be thus grappled by the long arms, and cut
and wounded by the sharp crooked spines of a Briar.
True, says the Briar, but recollect that you intended
to have made me serve your turn, and would, without
ceremony, have trampled me down to the ground: but
none of your freedoms with me, Master Reynard; you
may make a convenience of others perhaps, but the
family of the Briars are not of that cast. Whoever
presumes to use any impudent familiarities with them,

the mice with which it was infested. That may be,
said the Man, but you do not do this with the intention

of serving yourself; and besides, you are so ferocious
and cruel a little creature, that you kill every animal

that the unprincipled and mercenary thief-taker would
like well to be accounted a public spirited man; and
he cannot help boasting of his services as such. The
hangman’s pretensions are of the same kind: but however
useful and necessary some of such a description of

who are a nuisance to civilized society, yet the
instruments themselves are very like in character to the
Weasel in the Fable. The same may be said of those
factious writers, who pester the public with their clamorous

whose real motive is either to gain money by the sale

a Lion growling over it, and feeding upon it. This

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> ought never to supplicate the Divine power,

passion, cannot, it is presumed, be acceptable
to the Deity; and of all the involuntary sins which
men commit, scarcely any are more frequent than their
praying absurdly and improperly, as well as unseasonably,
when their time might have been employed to a
better purpose. Would men, as they ought to do,
obey the commands of Omnipotence, by fulfilling their
moral duties, and endeavour with all their might to
live as justly as they can, a just Providence would give
them what they ought to have: but stupidity and ignorance,
until better informed, and divested of superstition
and bigotry, will continue to form their notions
of the Supreme Being from their own poor shallow
conceptions; and nothing contributes more to keep up
this injudicious practice among simple, but perhaps
well-meaning people, than the numerous collections of
those crude rhapsodies, the offspring of itinerant bigotry,
with which the country overflows; while most of
those prayers are neglected which have been composed
with due reflection and matured deliberation, by the
most learned and pious of men. This Fable also
teaches us, that frequently the gratification of our vain
prayers would only lead us into dangers and evils, of
the existence of which we had no previous suspicion.</p>

of which the remembrance of past crimes will

who could but just dip in the point of his bill, was not
a bit the better for his entertainment. However, a
few days after, he returned the compliment, and invited
the Fox; but suffered nothing to be brought to
table excepting some minced meat in a glass jar, the
neck of which was so deep, and so narrow, that,
though the Stork with his long bill made a shift to
fill his belly, all that the Fox, who was very hungry,
could do, was to lick the brims as the Stork slabbered
them with his eating. Reynard was heartily vexed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
first; but when he came to take his leave, owned ingenuously,
that he had been used as he deserved; and
that he had no reason to take any treatment ill, of

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is very imprudent, as well as uncivil, to affront

we are too apt, when the jest comes to be turned home

make a proper impression of gratitude upon them, but
are not able to restrain them from repaying benevolence
with injuries. Moralists, in all ages, have incessantly
declaimed against the enormity of this crime,
concluding that they who are capable of injuring their
benefactors, are not fit to live in a community; being
such as the natural ties of parent, friend, or country
are too weak to restrain within the bounds of society.
Indeed, the sin of ingratitude is so detestable, that none
but the basest tempers can be guilty of it. Men of low
grovelling minds, who have been rescued from indigence
by the hand of benevolence, or of charity, forget
their benefactors, as well as their original wretchedness;
and as soon as prosperity flows upon them, it
too often serves only to rekindle their native rancour
and venom, and they hiss and brandish their tongues
against those who are so inadvertent or unfortunate as

But Reynard finding the Cock was inaccessible, had

the tree, Cousin, says he, I am heartily glad to
see you; but I cannot forbear expressing my uneasiness
at the inconvenience of the place, which will not let me
pay my respects to you in a better manner, though
I suppose you will come down presently, and that
difficulty will be removed. Indeed, cousin, says the

venture upon the ground; for, though I am convinced
how much you are my friend, yet I may have the misfortune

and what will become of me then? O dear, says Reynard,
is it possible you do not know of the peace that
has been so lately proclaimed between all kinds of birds
and beasts; and that we are for the future to forbear
hostilities, and to live in harmony, under the severest
penalties. All this while the Cock seemed to give little
attention to what was said, but stretched out his neck
as if he saw something at a distance. Cousin, says the
Fox, what is that you look at so earnestly? Why,
says the Cock, I think I see a pack of hounds yonder,
a good way off. O then, says the Fox, your humble

In a race I could leave you twenty miles behind me, in

thinking herself certain of winning the race, she made

ought to keep in mind, as it has guided many a plain
plodding man, with steady aim, to carry his point effectually
in making his own fortune, and at the same
time gaining the esteem of the world. Industry and
application to business make amends for the want of a
quick and ready wit; but men of great natural abilities,
and vivacity of imagination, often presume too
much upon the superiority of their genius, and if to
this presumption they add pride and conceit, they despise
the drudgery of business, and suffer their affairs
to go to disorder or ruin, through idleness and neglect.</p>

<p>Nature cannot by any art or labour be changed;
she may indeed be wrought upon and moulded by
good council and discipline; but it is in vain to attempt
a total transformation of our genius, person, or
complexion: therefore our application, assiduity, and
pains, when wrong directed, are of no avail. We
should, indeed, strive to discover which way the bent
of our genius lies, that we may apply ourselves to a
judicious cultivation and improvement of it; but we
ought to be sure never to thwart or oppose nature’s
fixed laws. When men aspire to eminence in any of
the various arts or sciences, without being gifted with
the innate powers or abilities for such attainments, it
is only like attempting to wash the Blackamoor white.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE LION IN LOVE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Lion by chance saw a fair maid, the forester’s
daughter, as she was tripping over a lawn, and fell in
love with her. Nay, so violent was his passion, that
he could not live unless he made her his own; therefore,
without more delay, he broke his mind to the father,
and demanded the damsel for his wife. The
man, odd as the proposal seemed at first, soon recollected
that, by complying, he might get the Lion into
his power; but, by refusing him, should only exasperate
and provoke his rage. Accordingly, he seemed
to consent; but told him it must be upon these conditions:
that, considering the girl was young and tender,
he must let his teeth be plucked out, and his claws be
cut off, lest he should hurt her, or at least frighten her
with the apprehension of them. The Lion was too
much in love to hesitate; but was no sooner deprived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
of his teeth and claws, than the treacherous forester
attacked him with a huge club, and knocked out his
brains.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Of</span> all the ill consequences that may attend the
blind passion of love, few prove so fatal as that of its
drawing people into a sudden and ill-concerted marriage.
In the midst of a fit of madness, they commit
a rash act, of which, as soon as they come to themselves,
they find reason to repent as long as they live.
Many an unthinking young man has been treated as
much like a savage in this respect as the Lion in the
Fable. He has, perhaps, had nothing valuable belonging
to him but his estate, and the documents
which formed his title to it; and if he is so far captivated,
as to be persuaded to part with these, his teeth
and his claws are gone, and he lies entirely at the mercy
of madam and her relations, who will most likely
not fail to keep him in complete subjection, after they
have stripped him of all his power. Nothing but a
true friendship, and a mutual interest, can keep up a
reciprocal love between the conjugal pair, and when
these are wanting, contempt and aversion soon step
in to supply their place. Matrimony then becomes a
state of downright enmity and hostility; and what a
miserable case he must be in, who has put himself and
his whole power into the hands of his enemy. Let
those reflect upon this (while they are in their sober
senses) who abhor the thoughts of being betrayed into
their ruin, by following the impulse of a blind unheeding
passion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE FOX AND THE HEDGEHOG.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Fox, in swimming across a river, was forced
down by the rapidity of the stream to a place where
the bank was so steep and slippery, that he could not
ascend it. While he was struggling in this situation,
a swarm of flies settled on his head and eyes, and tormented
him grievously. A Hedgehog, who saw and
pitied his condition, offered to call in the assistance of
the Swallow to drive them away. No, no, friend, replies
the Fox, I thank you for your kind offer; but it
is better to let this swarm alone, for they are already
pretty well filled, and should they be driven away, a
fresh and more hungry set would succeed them, and
suck me until I should not have a drop of blood left in
my veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable is recorded by Aristotle, who tells us
that Æsop spoke it to the Samians on occasion of a
popular sedition, to dissuade them from deposing their
great minister of state, lest they might, in getting rid
of one who was already glutted with their spoils, make
room for a more hungry and rapacious one in his stead.
By this it would appear, that some ministers of state
in ancient times, instead of being guided by integrity
and patriotism, were intent only upon filling their own
coffers, and aggrandizing and enriching their own relations,
from the plunder of the people whose affairs
they were entrusted with; and that they considered
them as their prey, rather than their charge. A succession
of such ministers, who can be countenanced by
weak monarchs only, is more calamitous to a nation
than plague, pestilence, and famine; for the effects of
their mal-administration do not end with their wicked
lives, but lay the foundation of ruin to nations that
would, under a patriotic government, have been virtuous,
great, and flourishing.</p>

So, ho! what, sit there and be killed! prithee up and
away; I dare say if you would but try, so swift a creature
as you are would easily escape from an Eagle.
As he was going on with his cruel raillery, down came
a Hawk and snapped him up, and notwithstanding his

The Hare, who was just expiring, addressing
her last words to the Sparrow, said, You who just now

arguments were necessary, or might be supposed capable
of enforcing moral precepts on those who cannot
be actuated by humanity, it might be added, that the
vicissitudes of human affairs render such behaviour imprudent,

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE MAN AND HIS TWO WIVES.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Man, in times when polygamy was allowed, had
two wives, one of whom, like himself, had seen her
best days, and was verging upon the decline of life,
but possessed many engaging qualities. The other
was young and beautiful, and shared the affection of
her husband, whom she made as happy as he was capable
of being, but was not completely so herself.
The white hairs mixed with the black upon the good
man’s head, gave her some uneasiness, by proclaiming
the great disparity of their years; wherefore, under
colour of dressing his head, she plucked out the silver
hairs, that he might still have as few visible signs of an
advanced age as possible. The older dame, for reasons
directly opposite, esteemed these grey locks as
the honours of his head, and thought, while they gave
him a venerable look, they made her appear something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
younger, so that every time she combed his head, she
took equal pains to extirpate the black hairs. Each
continued her project, unknown to the other, until the
poor man, who thought their desire to oblige him put
them upon this extraordinary officiousness in dressing
his head, found himself without any hair at all!</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">As</span> Christianity has banished polygamy, no immediate
moral can be derived by husbands from this Fable,
unless we conclude, that it is as impossible to serve two
mistresses as two masters; for whatever we do to please
the one, will probably offend the other. To conciliate
the affections of persons whose tempers are opposite,
is extremely difficult, if not impracticable. To wives
it may teach, that those whose love is tempered with a
tolerable share of good sense, will be sure to have no
separate views of their own, nor do any thing immediately
relating to their husbands, without consulting
them first. All that we shall add to what has been
said, is to observe, that many women may ignorantly,
out of a pure effect of complaisance, do a thousand disagreeable
things to their husbands. But in a married
state, one party should not be guessing at or presuming,
but inform themselves certainly, what will please
the other; and if a wife use her husband like a friend
only, the least she can do is first to communicate to
him all the important enterprizes she undertakes, and
especially those which she intends should be for his
honour and advantage.</p>

shop of a famous Statuary, where images were to be
sold. He saw Jupiter, Juno, and himself, and most
of the other gods and goddesses: so, pretending that
he wanted to buy, he asked the prices of several, and at
length pointing to Jupiter, What, says he, is the lowest
price you will take for that? A crown, says the other;
and what for that? pointing to Juno: I must have
something more for that. Mercury then, casting his
eye upon the figure of himself, with all his symbols
about it, Here am I, said he to himself, in quality of
Jupiter’s messenger, and the patron of artisans, with
all my trades about me; and then smiling with a self-sufficient
air, and pointing to the image, and pray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
friend, what is the price of this elegant figure? Oh,
replied the Statuary, if you will buy Jupiter and Juno,
I will throw you that into the bargain.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">If</span> we knew ourselves, of what could any of us be

of perverted pride. Humility is the constant attendant

them to see how far they are short of perfection;
but the vain and arrogant conceive they have attained
its height. All vain men, who affect popularity, fancy
other people have the same opinion of them that they
have of themselves; but nothing makes them look so
cheap and little in the eyes of discerning people as their
enquiring (like Mercury in the Fable) after their own
worth, and wanting to know what value others set upon
them: and those who are so full of themselves, as
to hunt for praise, and lay traps for commendation,
will generally be disappointed, and be marked out as
the emptiest of fellows; for it argues a littleness of
mind to be too anxious and solicitous concerning our
fame. He that behaves himself as he should do, need
not fear procuring a good share of respect, and a fair
reputation; but then these should not be the end or the
motive of our pursuits: our principal aim should be
the welfare of our country, our friends, and ourselves,

schemes, which they have ready made out,
to entice their victims to embark along with them. By
credulity, they hope to establish their own fortune,
and provided this be done, they care not, even if the
ruin of their unsuspecting associates follow. It will
likewise ever be found that when an honest man and

That little bird, says he, charms every ear with

uneasiness of her favourite bird, answered him very
kindly to this purpose: If the Nightingale be blest with
a fine voice, you have the advantage in point of beauty
and majesty of person. Ah! said the Peacock, but
what avails my silent unmeaning beauty, when I am so
far excelled in voice? The Goddess dismissed him
with this advice: Consider that the properties of every

beauty; strength to the Eagle; to the Nightingale a
voice of melody; the faculty of speech to the Parrot;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> most useful lesson that we can possibly learn,

to enjoy those blessings that we have in our power,

Instead of being ambitious of having more endowments

pains to cultivate those we have; and which a sourness
or peevishness of temper, instead of improving,
will certainly lessen and impair. Whoever neglects
the happiness within his reach, in order to brood over
the consideration of how much happier he might have
been, had his situation been like that of others, ingeniously
contrives to torment himself, and opens a perpetual
source of discontent, which prevents his ever
being at ease. He does not reflect, or he would soon
discover, that all the desirable properties in the world
never centered in one man, and that those who have
had the greatest share of them, if of an unhappy disposition,
still wished for something more, and wanted to
possess some inherent gifts which shone forth in other
men: but such persons ought to be put in mind, that
it does not become mortals to repine at the will of

that they should hunt in company, and divide
the spoil. They accordingly met on a certain day,
and commenced the chase, and ere long they ran down
and killed a fine fat Deer, which was instantly divided
into four parts, there happening to be then only the
Lion and three others present. After the division was
made, the Lion advancing forward with an air of majesty,
and pointing to one of the shares, was pleased to
declare himself after the following manner: This I
take possession of as my right, which devolves to me,
as I am descended by a true, lineal, hereditary succession
from the royal family of Lion: that, pointing to
the second, I claim by, I think, no unreasonable title,
considering that the success of all the engagements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
you have with the enemy depends chiefly upon my
courage and conduct; and you very well know that
wars are too expensive to be carried on without large
supplies. Then, nodding his head towards the third,
that I shall take by virtue of my prerogative, to which
I make no question but so dutiful and loyal a people
will pay all the deference and regard that I can desire.
Now, as for the remaining part, the necessity of our
present affairs is so very urgent, our stock so low, and
our credit so impaired and weakened, that I must insist
upon your granting that without hesitation or demur;

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">No</span> alliance is safe which is made with the wicked, if
they be superior to us in power. The most solemn
treaties will be disregarded as soon as they can be broken
with advantage. Powerful potentates, when they
are regardless of moral obligation, and consider might
only to be right, will never want specious pretences to
furbish out their declarations of war, nor hesitate about
inveigling less powerful states to join them, and after
subduing the enemy, and seizing upon the spoils, will
fall upon their allies on the slightest pretences, or for
no better reason but because they are powerful enough
to do so. No man ought to be entrusted with unlimited
power; and when a community has been stupid
enough to put the management of their affairs into such
hands, they have ever found their confidence abused,
and their property invaded.</p>

expressed her surprise at their fancy, in making
choice of trees that bore nothing. Oh, says Jupiter,
the reason of that is plain enough, for we would not be
thought to dispense our favours with any mercenary
view. You may do as you please, says she, but let
the Olive be my tree; and I declare my reason for

glory is but a silly business.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> all our actions, we should intend something useful
and beneficial; for the standing value of all things
is in proportion to their use. To undertake affairs
with no other view but that of empty glory, whatever
some curious dreamers may fancy, is employing our

the world out of his infinite goodness, for the good
of his creatures, and not out of a passion for glory,
which is a vain, silly, mean principle; and when we
talk of glorifying the Author of our being, if we think
reasonably, we must mean shewing our gratitude to
him, by imitating this goodness of his, as far as we are
able, and endeavouring to make some good or other
the aim of all our undertakings. For if empty glory
be unworthy the pursuit of a wise man, how vastly improper
must it be to make an offering of it to an all-wise
Deity.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Viper having entered a smith’s shop, looked up

upon a file, he greedily seized upon it, and fell to
gnawing it with his teeth. After he had spent some
time in his attempts to devour it, the File told him
very gruffly, that he had better be quiet and let him
alone; for he would get very little by nibbling at one
who, upon occasion, could bite iron and steel.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable is levelled at those spiteful people who
take so malignant a pleasure in the design of hurting
others, as not to feel and understand that they hurt
only themselves; and at those who are blinded by envy,
which prompts them rather than not bite at all, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
fall foul where they cannot expect their nibbling will
meet with any thing but disappointment, as every one
must who is biting at that which is too hard for his

twin brothers, and the offspring of envy, are, as well
as their parent, their own tormentors. They intend
that the wounds they inflict should be deadly, and the
greatest wits and brightest characters in all ages have
been the objects of their attacks; but the brilliancy
of truth and justice at length shines forth, and shews
the deformity of such characters in the clearest light.
Other people, of the same character and disposition,
though of minor consideration indeed, ought not to
be passed over unnoticed. These may be called nibblers,
who let their tongues slip very freely, in censuring
the actions of persons who, in the esteem of
the world, are of such an unquestionable reputation,
that nobody will believe what is insinuated against
them, and of such influence through their own veracity,
that the least word from them would ruin the
credit of such adversaries to all intents and purposes.
The efforts of little villains of this stamp, like dirty liquor
squirted against the wind, recoil back and bespatter
their own faces; or like the shades of a picture,

No, replies the other, but I am hanging a Wolf in

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> ought not to judge of men by their looks, or
their dress and appearances, but by the character of
their lives and conversation, and by their works; for
when we do not examine these, we must not be surprized
if we find that we have mistaken evil for good,
and instead of an innocent sheep, taken a wolf in disguise
under our protection. The finished hypocrite,
by assuming the character of virtue, makes the vice
more odious and abominable, and when the mask is
torn off, and fraud and imposture are detected, every
honest man rejoices in the punishment of the offender.
Men who have not had good, religious, and moral
principles early instilled into their minds, find no barrier
to check their propensity to evil, and get hardened
as they advance in years; and even the most liberal
education, if it want the foundation of truth and honesty,
is often a curse instead of a blessing, and the
objects of it fail to do honour either to themselves or
to their country. Thus it is we see tyranny stalking
along under the mask of care and protection. Injustice
sets up the letter of the law against its spirit.
Oppression strips the widow and the orphan, and at
the same time preaches up mercy and compassion.
Treachery covers itself under a cloak of kindness; and
above all, it is peculiarly painful to find numbers of
men, even of the learned professions, who ought to
set an example of probity and honour, misapply their
abilities to twist and pervert the sacred meaning of

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE STAG IN THE OX-STALL.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Stag, pursued by the hunters, took refuge in a
stable, and begged of the Oxen, to suffer him to conceal
himself under the straw in one of the stalls. They
told him that he would be in great danger there, for
both the master and the servants would soon come to
fodder them, and then he might be sure of meeting
his doom. Ah! says the Stag, if you will be so good
as not betray me, I hope I shall be safe enough. Presently,
in came a servant, who gave a careless look
around, and then went out without any discovery. All
the other servants of the farm came and went like the
first. Upon this, the Stag began to exult, imagining
himself quite secure; but a shrewd old Ox told him
that he was reckoning upon his safety too soon, for
there was another person to come, by whom he would
not so readily be looked over. Accordingly, by and
by came the master, who carefully peeped into every
corner, and at last, in turning over the litter, discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
the Stag’s horns sticking out of the straw: upon
which, he called all his servants back, and soon made
prize of the poor creature.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable is levelled against those worthless hirelings,
who slide over their time in negligent disorder,
and this not so much for want of capacity as honesty;
their own private interest almost solely occupying their
attention, while that of their master, whose wages they
receive, and whose bread they eat, is postponed, or
entirely neglected. Such servants deserve not to be
inmates in any good man’s house; but where they are,
it is absolutely necessary for the governors of families to
look into their affairs with their own eyes; for though
they may happen not to be in personal danger from the
treachery of their domestics, they are perpetually liable
to injuries from their negligence, which leaves the
master open to the artifices of those who would defraud
him. Few families are reduced to poverty merely by
their own extravagance: the inattention of servants
swells every article of expence in domestic economy;
and the retinue of great men, instead of exerting their
industry to increase their master’s wealth, commonly
exercise no other office than that of caterpillars, to
consume and devour it. The fate of the Stag also
warns us not to engage in any hazardous speculation,
the success of which is to depend upon the ignorance
or carelessness of those with whom we have to deal; for
though we may over-reach one or two, yet some master-eye
is sure at last to pierce our covering of straw,
and make us pay dearly for deviating from the straight
road of candour and prudence.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Fowler took his gun, and went into the woods a-shooting.
He spied a Ring-dove among the branches
of an Oak, and clapping the piece to his shoulder, took
his aim, and made himself sure of killing it. But just
as he was going to pull the trigger, an Adder, which
he had trod upon under the grass, bit him so painfully
in the leg, that he was obliged to quit his design, and
throw his gun down in an agony. The venom immediately
infected his blood, and his whole body began
to mortify; which, when he perceived, he could not
help owning it to be just. Fate, says he, has brought
destruction upon me, while I was contriving the death
of another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> mischief that bad men meditate to others, commonly,
like a judgment, falls upon their own heads;
and the punishment of wickedness is so just in itself
that the sufferer, who has made others feel it, cannot,
if he think rightly, but confess that he deserves the
like inflicted on himself. The hardened unfeeling
heart of a cruel and unjust man, can, however, continue
to do a thousand bitter things to others, until he
tastes calamity himself, and then only it is that he feels
the insupportable uneasiness it occasions. Why should
we think others born to hard treatment more than
ourselves, or imagine it can be reasonable to do to
another what we should think very hard to suffer in
our own persons?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE HARES AND THE FROGS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Hares in a certain park having met to consult
upon some plan to preserve themselves from their numerous
enemies, all agreed that life was full of care
and misery, and that they saw no prospect of things
changing for the better. Full of these desponding
thoughts, and just as it had been proposed that they
should put an end to their existence, a storm arose,
which tore the branches from the trees, and whirled the
leaves about their ears. Panic-struck, they ran like
mad creatures, until they were stopped by a lake, into
which they hastily resolved to throw themselves headlong,
rather than lead a life so full of dangers and
crosses: but upon their approaching its margin, a number
of Frogs, which were sitting there, frightened at
their sudden approach, in the greatest confusion leapt
into the water, and dived to the bottom; which an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
Hare, more sedate than the rest, observing, called out,
Have a care what ye do! Here are other creatures I
perceive, which have their fears as well as we. Dont
then let us fancy ourselves the most miserable of any
upon earth; but rather, by their example, learn to
bear patiently those inconveniences which nature has
thrown upon us.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable is designed to shew us how unreasonable
many people are, who live in continual fears and
disquiet about the miserableness of their condition.
There is hardly any state of life great enough to satisfy
the wishes of an ambitious man; and scarcely any
so mean, but may supply the necessities of him that is
moderate. There are few beings so very wretched,
that they cannot pick out others in a more deplorable
situation, and with whom they would not change cases.
The rich man envies the poor man’s health, without
considering his wants; and the poor man envies the
other’s treasure, without considering his diseases. The
miseries of others should serve to add vigour to our
minds, and teach us to bear up against the load of
lighter misfortunes. But what shall we say to those
who have a way of creating themselves panics from
the rustling of the wind, the scratching of a rat or a
mouse behind the hangings, the fluttering of a moth,
or the motion of their own shadow by moon-light!
Their whole life is as full of alarms as that of a Hare,
and they never think themselves so easy as when, like
the timorous folks in the Fable, they meet with a set
of creatures as fearful as themselves.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Mountains were said to be in labour, and uttered
the most dreadful groans. People came together,
far and near, to see what birth would be produced;
and after they had waited a considerable time in expectation,
out crept a Mouse.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Projectors</span> of all kinds, who endeavour by artful
rumours, large promises, and vast preparations, to
raise the expectations of mankind, and then by their
mean performances disappoint them, have, time out of
mind, been lashed with the recital of this Fable. It
should teach us to suspect those who promise very
largely, and to examine cautiously what grounds they
proceed upon, and whether their pretensions are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
intended to render us their tools, or the dupes of their
artifices. It likewise teaches us not to rely implicitly
upon those constant declarations for liberty and the
public good, which artful politicians use as stepping
stones to power; but who having raised the people’s expectations
to the highest pitch, and obtained their desire
by the public enthusiasm, then turn their whole art
and cunning to embezzling the public treasure for their
own private wicked ends, or to ruin and enslave their
country; or at best but imitate the bad conduct of
those whom they turned out by their clamour, while
the sanguine hopes of all those that wished well to virtue,
and flattered themselves with a reformation of
every thing that opposed the well-being of the community,
vanish away in smoke, and are lost in a gloomy
uncomfortable prospect. The Fable likewise intimates,
that the uncertain issue of all human undertakings
should induce us not to make pompous boasts of ourselves,
but to guard against promising any thing exceedingly
great, for fear of coming off with a production
ridiculously little. If we set out modestly, and
perform more than we engaged to do, we shall find
our fame grow upon us, and every unexpected addition
we make to our plan will raise us more and more in
the good opinion of the world; but if, on the contrary,
we make ample professions of the greatness of our designs,
and the excellence of our own abilities, it will
too often happen, that instead of swelling our reputation,
we shall only blow the trumpet to our shame.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> certain Jack-daw was so proud and ambitious,
that, not contented to live within his own sphere, he
picked up the feathers which fell from the Peacocks,
stuck them in among his own, and very confidently
introduced himself into an assembly of those beautiful
birds. They soon found him out, stripped him of his
borrowed plumes, and falling upon him with their
sharp bills, punished him as his presumption deserved.
Upon this, full of grief and affliction, he returned to
his old companions, and would have lived with them
again; but they, knowing his late life and conversation,
industriously avoided him, and refused to admit
him into their company; and one of them, at the same
time, gave him this serious reproof: If, friend, you
could have been contented with our station, and had
not disdained the rank in which nature had placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
you, you had not been used so scurvily by those upon
whom you intruded yourself, nor suffered the notorious
slight which now we think ourselves obliged to put
upon you.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">To</span> aim at making a figure by the means of either
borrowed wit, or borrowed money, generally subjects
us at last to a ten-fold ridicule. A wise man, therefore,
will take his post quietly, in his own station,
without pretending to fill that of another, and never
affect to look bigger than he really is, by means of a
false or borrowed light. It shews great weakness and
vanity in any man to be pleased at making an appearance
above what he really is; but if to enable him to
do so with something of a better grace, he has clandestinely
feathered his nest out of his neighbour’s goods,
it is a pity if he should not be found out, stripped of
his plunder, and treated like a felonious rogue into
the bargain.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Lion having laid down to take his repose under
the spreading boughs of a shady tree, a company of
Mice scampered over his back and waked him. Upon
which, starting up, he clapped his paw upon one of
them, and was just going to put it to death, when the
little suppliant implored his mercy, begging him not
to stain his noble character with the blood of so small
and insignificant a creature. The Lion, touched with
compassion, instantly released his little trembling captive.
Not long after, traversing the forest in search
of his prey, he chanced to run into the toils of the
hunters, and not being able to disengage himself, he
set up a loud roar. The Mouse hearing the voice,
and knowing it to be the Lion’s, immediately repaired
to the place, and bade him fear nothing, for that he
was his friend. Instantly he fell to work, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
his little sharp teeth gnawed asunder the knots and
fastenings of the toils, and set the royal brute at liberty.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">They</span> who generously shower benefits on their fellow-creatures,
seldom fail of inspiring the great bulk
of them with a benevolent regard for their benefactors,
and often receive returns of kindness which they never
expected. Mercy is of all other virtues the most likely
to kindle gratitude in those to whom it is extended,
and it is difficult to find an instance of a conqueror
who ever had occasion to repent of his humanity and
clemency. The Fable gives us to understand, that
there is no person in the world so little, but even the
greatest may, at some time or other, stand in need of
his assistance; and consequently, it is good to shew favour,
when there is room for it, towards those who
fall into our power. As the lowest people in life may,
upon occasion, be able either to serve or hurt us, it is
as much our interest as our duty to behave with good-nature
and lenity towards all with whom we have any
intercourse. A great soul is never so much delighted
as when an opportunity offers of making a return for
favours received; and a sensible man, however exalted
his station, will never consider himself secure from the
necessity of accepting a service from the poorest.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Tortoise, weary of his condition, by which he
was confined to creep upon the ground, and ambitious
to look about him with a larger prospect, proclaimed
that if any bird would take him up into the air, and
shew him the world, he would reward him with the
discovery of an invaluable treasure, which he knew was
hidden in a certain place of the earth. The Eagle accepted
the offer, and having performed his undertaking,
gently set the Tortoise again on the ground, and
demanded the reward. The Tortoise was obliged to
confess that he could not fulfil his promise, which he
had made only with the view of having his fancy gratified.
The Eagle, stung with resentment at being thus
duped, grasped him again in his talons, and then soaring
to a great height, let him fall, by which he was
dashed to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Men</span> of honour are careful not to tarnish their reputations
by falsifying their word, and always consider
well how far it may be in their power to fulfil their
promises before they make them. They always strive
to walk on the straight line of rectitude; and should
they, in an unguarded moment, happen to stagger
from it, they instantly retrace their steps, and feel unhappy
until they have regained their station. There
is a simplicity in truth and virtue, which requires no
artifices, and never leads us into difficulties, but points
out the plain and safe way. Deceit and cunning, on
the contrary, involve those who practise them in a
maze, and they are bewildered in their own falsehoods,
from which no dexterity can extricate them. The
brain-racking schemes which villains practise to delude
others, are commonly detected, and end in the unpitied
punishment of themselves; for they seldom discover
the folly of being wicked, until it has betrayed
them into their ruin. But such persons would do well
to refresh their memories with the old adage which
says, that “all knaves are fools, but all fools are not
knaves.”</p>

on the farm-yard, having a mind to make a meal of
the blood of the Cock, seized him one morning by surprize,
and asked him what he could say for himself
why slaughter should not pass upon him? The Cock
replied, that he was serviceable to mankind by crowing
in the morning, and calling them up to their daily labour.
That is true, says the Polecat, and is the very
objection that I have against you, for you make such
a shrill impertinent noise, that people cannot sleep for
you. Besides, you are an incestuous rascal, and make
no scruple of lying with your mother and sisters.
Well, says the Cock, this I do not deny; but I do it
to procure eggs and chickens for my master. Ah!
villain, says the Polecat, hold your wicked tongue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
such impieties as these declare that you are no longer
fit to live.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> a wicked man in power has a mind to glut
his appetite in any respect, innocence or even merit is
no protection against him. The cries of justice and
the voice of reason, are of no effect upon a conscience
hardened in iniquity, and a mind versed in a long
practice of wrong and robbery. Remonstrances, however
reasonably urged, or movingly couched, have no
more influence upon the hearts of such, than the gentle
evening breeze has upon the oak, when it whispers
among its branches; or the rising surges upon the
deaf rock, when they dash and break upon its sides.
Power should never be trusted in the hands of an impious
selfish man, and one that has more regard to the
gratification of his own insatiable desires, than to public
peace and justice; but as a wicked son may succeed
to the station of a virtuous and patriotic father, care
should be taken to guard against a surprise, by a vigilant
watchfulness of the encroaching nature of power,
even when in benevolent hands, that those checks may
not be undermined which counteract its abuse in bad
ones. Had the poor Cock exerted his usual vigilance,
it would have served him much more effectually than
either his innocence or his eloquence.</p>

tackle in order, by the side of a coppice, when a Blackbird,
who was perched on an adjacent tree, eyed him
with great attention; but being at a loss to know the
use of all this apparatus and preparation, had the curiosity
to ask him what he was doing. I am, says the
Fowler, building a fine city for you birds to live in,
and providing it with meat and all manner of conveniences
for you. Having said this, he departed and hid
himself, and the Blackbird, believing his words, came
into the nets and was taken; but when the man ran
up to seize his captive, the Bird thus addressed him:
If this be your faith, and these the cities you build, it
will be a great pity if you should ever again persuade
any poor simple bird to try to inhabit them.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> fowler’s professions of friendship for the birds,
while he aimed at their destruction, may be paralleled
by too many instances in real life; and however mortifying
it may be to reflect upon, yet so it is, that the
designing knave far too often succeeds in his deep-laid
schemes to ensnare, over-reach, and ruin the honest

this character, both of high and low degree, are suffered
to roam at large, and it behoves the inexperienced to
guard against their plots with a watchful eye; for while
they smoothly disclaim taking any mean advantage over
those they are addressing, with their plausible pretensions,
their sole study and aim is to fill their own pockets,
and then to hug themselves with the thoughts of
their success, and to laugh at those whom they have
duped. As long as people can be found credulous
enough to suffer themselves to be imposed upon, so
long will there arise gentry of this description, who
will live in affluence by taking advantage of their weakness.</p>

child, among other things threatened to throw it out
of doors to the Wolf, if it did not leave off crying. A
Wolf, who chanced to be prowling near the door just
at the time, heard the expression, and believing the
woman to be in earnest, waited a long while about the
house, in expectation of having her words made good.
But at last the child, wearied with its own perverseness,
fell asleep, and the Wolf was forced to return
back into the woods, empty and supperless. The Fox
meeting him, and surprized to see him going home so
thin and disconsolate, asked him what the matter was,
and how he came to speed no better that night? Ah!
do not ask me, says he, I was so silly as to believe
what the Nurse said, and have been disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Many</span> of the old moralists have interpreted this Fable
as a caution never to trust a woman: a barbarous
inference, which neither the obvious sense of the apologue,
nor the disposition of the softer sex will warrant.
For though some women may be fickle and unstable,
yet the generality exceed their calumniators in truth
and constancy, and have more frequently to complain of
being the victims, than to be arraigned as the authors of
broken vows. To us this Fable appears to mean little
more than merely to shew how easily inclined we are,
in all our various expectations through life, to delude
ourselves into a belief of any thing which we desire to
be true. The lover interprets every smile of his mistress
in his own favour, and is then perhaps neglected.
The beauty believes all mankind are dying for her,
and is then deserted by her train of admirers. The
followers of the great reckon a smile or a nod very auspicious
omens, and deceive themselves with groundless
hopes of employment or promotion, in expectation of
which, they, like the Wolf at the Nurse’s door, dangle
away the time that might be usefully employed elsewhere,
and at last are obliged to retire disappointed
and hungry, crying out perhaps against the perfidy of
those in power, instead of blaming their own sanguine
credulity.</p>

parts in the public theatre, where he fancied he could
not fail of raising a great reputation and fortune in a

trial; but the spaciousness of the place, and the throng
of the people, so deadened and weakened both his voice
and instrument, that scarcely either of them could be
heard, and where they could, his performance sounded
so poor, so low, and wretched, in the ears of his refined
audience, that he was universally hissed off the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> we are commended for our performances by
people of much flattery or little judgment, we should

caution, many a vain unthinking man has at once exposed
himself to the censure of the world. A buffoon,
though he would not be fit to open his mouth in
a senate, or upon a subject where sound sense and a
grave and serious behaviour are expected, may be very
agreeable to a company disposed to be mirthful over
a glass of wine. It is not the diverting a little, insignificant,
injudicious audience or society, which can
gain us a proper esteem, or insure our success, in a
place which calls for a performance of the first rate.
We should have either allowed abilities to please the
most refined tastes, or judgment enough to know that
we want them, and to have a care how we submit ourselves
to the trial. And, if we have a mind to pursue
a just and true ambition, it is not sufficient that we
study barely to please; but it is of the greatest moment
whom we please, and in what respect, otherwise
we may not only lose our labour, but make ourselves
ridiculous into the bargain.</p>

is spent differently: I lead a life of industry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>

constantly held up as an example of prudence and

wants, and court not the favors, nor dread the frowns,
of any one; while your laziness and vanity make you a
beggarly intruder wherever you hope to get a present
supply. You may, perhaps, sip honey one day, but on
the next you batten on carrion; and having propagated
a numerous progeny, equally as noxious and useless
as yourself, I then behold you from my comfortable,
warm, well-stored mansion, in the winter of your

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> worthless part of mankind, who pass through
the world without being of any service in it, and without
acquiring the least reputation, seldom fail of adding
empty pride to all their other failings, and behave
with arrogance towards those who contribute to the
comforts and happiness of society. They treat industrious
persons as wretched drudges, appointed to labour
for a poor subsistence, while they think themselves
entitled to enjoy all the good things of this life,
though they of all others least deserve them. But the
worthy and industrious will generally find that the
pride and extravagance of these idle flies, bring them
at last to shame, if not to want, while their own honest
labours secure a good name, a happy mind, and a
sufficiency for their wants, if not a state of affluence.
In short, no one is a better gentleman than he whose
own honest industry supplies him with all necessaries,
and who pretends to no more acquaintance with honour
than never to say or do a mean or an unjust thing.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> thin hungry Mouse, after much pushing and
twisting, crept through a small hole, into a corn basket,
where he gorged himself so plentifully, that on
his attempting to retire by the same passage, he found
himself so swelled out, that, with all his endeavours,
he could not squeeze through again. A Weasel, who
stood at some distance, and had been diverting himself
with the vain efforts of the little glutton, called to
him sneeringly, Hark ye, Mr Mouse! remember that
you were lean and half-starved when you got in at that

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">That</span> portion of mankind, whose inordinate desires
push them on to stick at nothing in acquiring wealth,
are seldom the most happy; for covetousness, which
never produced one noble sentiment, often urges its
votaries to break through the rules of justice, and then
deprives them of the expected fruits of their iniquity.
Besides great riches and care are almost inseparable;
and there is often a quiet and content attending upon
people of moderate circumstances, to which the wealthy
man is an utter stranger. It has happened, even to
monarchs, that their inroads on the possessions of
others have tended to the detriment of the aggressor,
who has been obliged to resign the rich spoils obtained
by unjustifiable hostilities, and to refund the ill-gotten
wealth, with a very bad grace: a punishment which
Providence has wisely annexed to acts of violence and
fraud, as the best security of the possessions of the
just and virtuous, against the attempts of the wicked.
Some men, from creeping in the lowest stations of life,
have in process of time reached the greatest places, and
grown so bulky by pursuing their insatiate appetite for
money, that when they would have retired, they found
themselves too opulent and full to get off. There has
been no expedient for them to creep out, till they were
squeezed and reduced in some measure to their primitive
littleness. They that fill themselves with that
which is the property of others, should always be so
served before they are suffered to escape.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> Eagle that had young ones, looking for something
to feed them with, happened to spy a Fox’s Cub
that lay basking itself abroad in the sun: she made a
stoop, and trussed it immediately; but before she had
carried it quite off, the old Fox coming home, implored
her, with tears, to spare her Cub, and pity the
distress of a poor fond mother, who would think no
affliction so great as that of losing her child. The
Eagle, whose nest was high in an old hollow tree,
thought herself secure from all projects of revenge, and
so bore away the Cub to her young ones, without
shewing any regard to the supplications of the Fox.
But that subtle creature, highly incensed at this outrageous
barbarity, ran to an altar, where some country
people had been sacrificing a kid in the open fields,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
and catching up a fire-brand in her mouth, made towards
the tree where the Eagle’s nest was, with a resolution
of revenge. She had scarcely reached its root,
when the Eagle, terrified with the approaching ruin of
herself and family, begged of the Fox to desist, and,
with much submission, returned her the Cub safe and
sound.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> men in high situations happen to be wicked,
how little scruple do they make of oppressing their
poor neighbours! They are perched upon a lofty station,
and, having outgrown all feelings of humanity,
are insensible to the pangs of remorse. The widow’s
tears, the orphan’s cries, and the curses of the miserable,
fall by the way, and never reach their hearts.
But let such, in the midst of their flagrant injustice,
remember how easy it is, notwithstanding their superior
distance, for the meanest vassal to take his revenge.
The bitterness of affliction (even where cunning
is wanting) may animate the poorest spirit with
desperate resolutions; and when once the fury of revenge
is thoroughly awakened, we know not what she
may effect before she is lulled to rest again. The most
powerful tyrants cannot prevent a resolved assassination:
there are a thousand different ways for any private
man to do the business, who is heartily disposed
to it, and willing to satisfy his appetite for revenge, at
the expence of his life. An old woman may clap a
fire-brand to the palace of a prince, and a poor weak

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> former days, it happened that the Members of
the human body, taking some offence at the conduct
of the Belly, resolved no longer to grant it the usual
supplies. The Tongue first, in a seditious speech, aggravated
their grievances; and after highly extolling
the activity and diligence of the Hands and Feet, set
forth how hard and unreasonable it was, that the fruits
of their labour should be squandered away upon the
insatiable cravings of a fat and indolent paunch. In
short, it was resolved for the future to strike off his
allowance, and let him shift for himself as well as he
could. The Hands protested they would not lift a Finger
to keep him from starving; and the Teeth refused
to chew a single morsel more for his use. In this distress,
the Belly remonstrated with them in vain; for
during the clamour of passion the voice of reason is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
always disregarded. This unnatural resolution was
kept as long as any thing of that kind can be kept,
which was, until each of the rebel members pined
away to the skin and bone, and could hold out no
longer. Then they found there was no doing without
the Belly, and, that idle and insatiable as it seemed,
it contributed as much to the welfare of all the other
parts, as they in their several stations did towards its
maintenance.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable was spoken by Menenius Agrippa, a
Roman consul and general, when he was deputed by
the senate to appease a dangerous tumult and insurrection
of the people. The many wars the Romans were
engaged in, and the frequent supplies they were obliged
to raise, had so soured and inflamed the minds of
the populace, that they were resolved to endure it no
longer, and obstinately refused to pay the taxes. It is
easy to discern how the great man applied this Fable:
for, if the branches and members of a community refuse
the government that aid which its necessities require,
the whole must perish together. The rulers of
a state, useless or frivolous as they may sometimes seem,
are yet as necessary to be kept up and maintained in
a proper and decent grandeur, as the family of each
private person is, in a condition suitable to itself.
Every man’s enjoyment of that little which he gains
by his daily labour, depends upon the government’s
being maintained in a condition to defend and secure
him in the unmolested control and possession of it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE FATAL MARRIAGE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Mouse being ambitious of marrying into a noble
family, paid his addresses to a young Lioness, and at
length succeeded in entering into a treaty of marriage
with her. When the day appointed for the nuptials
arrived, the bridegroom set out in a transport of joy
to meet his beloved bride; and coming up to her,
passionately threw himself at her feet; but she, like a
giddy thing as she was, not minding how she walked,
accidentally set her foot upon her little spouse, and
crushed him to death.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is very unsafe for persons of low estate to form
connections with those of a very superior situation.
When wealthy persons of mean extraction and unrefined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
education, as an equivalent for their money, demand
brides out of the nursery of the peerage, if they
should not be ruined by the giddy extravagance of
their high-born wives, their being despised, or at least
treated with neglect, is almost certain. But indeed,
much unhappiness follows the want of a sound judgment
in the choice of a partner for life, whether it be
in high or low, rich or poor. No human contract is
of so important, as well as delicate a nature, as marriage.
It is one of the grand epochs in the history
of a man. It is an engagement which should be
voluntary, judicious, and disinterested, and can never
be attended with honour, or blessed with happiness,
if it has not its origin in mutual affection. If it
be either unsuitable or compulsory, it produces not
only individual misery, but consequences universally
pernicious. Sordid interest and vile dependence may
indeed sometimes act so powerfully, as to set nature
and true convenience aside, so as to make the yoke
which is jointly borne by the improper union of the high
and low, or by age and youth, put on an appearance
of regard for each other; but natural affection must
needs be wanting on one side or the other. Nature
has, however, with a strong hand, pointed out the path
to be pursued, and a few prudential rules only are necessary
to keep us within it. If a man is of an unsound
constitution, or if he cannot provide for a family, let
him forbear matrimony: it is the duty of every man
who marries, to take a healthy woman for his wife, for
the sake of his children, and an amiable one, for his
own comfort. The same precaution ought to be taken
by the fair sex, unless they can make up their minds to
become nurses to tainted worn-out husbands, and their
puny nerveless offspring.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE YOUNG MAN AND THE LION.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> opulent Old Man, who believed in omens and
dreams, had an only Son, of whom he was dotingly
fond. One night he dreamt that he saw the Young
Man, while he was eagerly engaged in the chase, seized
upon and torn in pieces by a Lion. This operated
upon his fears to such a degree, that he instantly determined
upon breaking off his Son’s strong propensity
to hunting, that he might be kept out of harm’s
way. For this purpose, he spared neither pains nor
expence to make home agreeable to him. He had
the rooms decorated with the finest paintings of forest
scenery, and the hunting of wild beasts, with the reality
of which the youth had been so much delighted;
but the Young Man, debarred from his favourite pleasures,
considered the palace a prison, and his father
as the keeper. One day, when looking at the pictures,
he cast his eye upon that of a Lion, and, enraged that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
he was confined for a dream about such a beast, he
struck at the painting with his fist, with all his might.
There happened to be a nail in the wall behind the
canvas, which lacerated the hand terribly. The wound
festered, and threw the Young Man into a fever, of
which he died; so that the Father’s dream was fulfilled
by the very step he took to prevent it.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Those</span> people who govern their lives by forebodings

life is sufficiently loaded. Heaven has kindly concealed
from us the knowledge of futurity, and it is therefore
foolish for us to attempt to pry into it, or to disturb
our minds with absurd conceptions of events which
are only realised by our ridiculous precautions against
them. How inconsistent is the conduct of people who
imagine things to be predestined, and yet busy themselves
in endeavours to prevent their coming to pass;
as if the vain efforts of human power or prudence were
able to counteract the will, or reverse the decrees of
the Omnipotent.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Kite who had kept sailing in the air for many
days near a dove-house, and made a stoop at several
Pigeons to no purpose, for they were too nimble for
him, at last had recourse to stratagem, and made a
declaration to them, in which he set forth his own just
and good intentions, and that he had nothing more at
heart than the defence and protection of the Pigeons
in their ancient rights and liberties, and how concerned
he was at their unjust and unreasonable suspicions
of himself, as if he intended by force of arms to break
in upon their constitution, and erect a tyrannical government
over them. To prevent all which, and thoroughly
to quiet their minds, he thought proper to
propose such terms of alliance, as might for ever cement
a good understanding between them; one of
which was, that they should accept of him for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
king, and invest him with all kingly privilege and prerogative
over them; in return for which he promised
them protection from all their enemies. The poor
simple Pigeons consented: the Kite took the coronation
oath, after a very solemn manner, on his part,
and the Doves the oaths of allegiance and fidelity on
theirs. But much time had not passed over their
heads before the good Kite pretended that it was part
of his prerogative to devour a Pigeon whenever he
pleased; and this he was not contented to do himself
only, but instructed the rest of the royal family in the
same kingly arts. The Pigeons, reduced to this miserable
condition, said one to the other, Ah! we deserve
no better! Why did we let him come in?</p>

to the most unsociable of vices; and seldom have
any better excuse for such an error in politics, than
that they were deceived in their expectation, or never
thoroughly knew the manners of their king, till he had
got them entirely in his power. We ought not to incur
the possibility of being deceived in so important a

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE SICK KITE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Kite who had been sick a long time, beginning to
be doubtful of recovery, begged of his Mother to go
to all the churches and religious houses in the country,
to try what prayers and offerings would effect in his
behalf. The old Kite replied, Indeed, my dear son,
I would willingly undertake any thing to save your
life; but I have great reason to despair of doing you
any service in the way you propose: for, with what
face can I ask any thing of the Gods, in favour of one
whose whole life has been a continued scene of rapine
and injustice, and who has not scrupled, upon
occasion, to rob even their altars?</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> rehearsal of this Fable almost unavoidably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
draws our attention to that very serious and important
point, the consideration of a death-bed repentance, the
sincerity of which we may justly suspect in one whose
whole life has been spent in acts of wickedness and impiety.
To expose the absurdity of relying upon such
a weak foundation, we need only ask the same question
with the Kite in the Fable: how can he, who has
offended the Gods all his life-time by acts of dishonour
and injustice, expect that they will be pleased with him
at last, for no other reason but because he fears he
shall not be able to offend them any longer? Since
the summons to “pass that bourn whence no traveller
returns,” must one day come, we ought always
to be prepared to meet it. But when the whole life
has been wasted, without communion with, or totally
estranged from that Almighty Being, by whose fiat it
was called into existence, then indeed the polluted soul
must be distracted with the agonizing thoughts of appearing
before Him, who created it for a very different
purpose. Nothing but the consciousness of having led
a virtuous life, can in the awful moment, disarm death
of his terrors, and fortify the mind with cheering hopes
and resignation. But this is a subject of the utmost
importance, and the due enforcing of it is one of the
most solemn duties of the pulpit.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> first time the Fox saw the Lion, he fell down
at his feet, and was ready to die with fear. The second
time he took courage, and could even bear to
look upon him. The third time he had the impudence
to come up to him, to salute him, and to enter
into familiar conversation with him.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">From</span> this Fable we may observe the two extremes
in which we may fail as to a proper behaviour towards
our superiors. The one is a bashfulness, proceeding
either from a vicious guilty mind, or a timorous rusticity;
the other an over-bearing impudence, which assumes
more than becomes it, and so renders the person
insufferable to the conversation of well-bred reasonable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
people. But there is a difference between the bashfulness
which arises from a want of education, and the
shame-facedness that accompanies conscious guilt: the
first by time and a nearer acquaintance, may be ripened
into a proper liberal behaviour; the other no sooner
finds an easy practicable access, but it throws off all
manner of reverence, grows every day more and more
familiar, and branches out at last into the utmost indecency
and irregularity. Indeed there are many occasions
which may happen to cast an awe, or even a
terror, upon our minds at first view, without any just or
reasonable grounds; but upon a little recollection, or
a nearer insight, we recover ourselves, and can appear
indifferent and unconcerned, where before we were
ready to sink under a load of diffidence and fear. We
should upon such occasions use our endeavours to regain
a due degree of steadiness and resolution; but at
the same time we must have a care that our efforts in
that respect do not force the balance too much, and
make it rise to an unbecoming freedom, and an offensive
familiarity.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Wolf in quest of prey, happened to fall in with a
well-fed Mastiff. Ah, Tray, said he, one does not need
to ask how you do, you look so plump and hearty. I
wish I were as well provided for; but my gaunt looks
shew that I fare very differently, although I dare say I
venture my life ten times more than you do, in searching
for a precarious subsistence, amidst woods and
wilds, exposed to rain, and frost, and snow. If you
will follow me, replies the Dog, and do as I do, I
have no doubt you will change for the better, and soon
be in as good plight as I am. The Wolf eagerly requested
to be informed what would be required of him.
Very little, replied the Mastiff; only drive away beggars,
guard the master’s house, caress him, and be
submissive to his family, and you will be well fed
and warmly lodged. To these conditions the Wolf
had no objections; but as they were jogging along, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
observed the hair worn off around the Dog’s neck, and
enquired the cause. O nothing, answered he, or a
mere trifle; perhaps the collar, to which my chain is
fastened, has left a mark. Chain! replied the Wolf,
with some surprize; so then you are not permitted to go
where and when you please? Not always, said Tray;
but what does that signify? It signifies so much, rejoined
the Wolf, that I am resolved to partake of no
sumptuous fare with a chain about my neck; for half a
meal, with liberty, is preferable to a full one without it.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">True</span> greatness of soul will never give up liberty for
any consideration whatever; for what are riches, grandeur,
titles, or any other worldly good, if they are
holden by so precarious a tenure as the arbitrary will
of a tyrant! A mere competency, with liberty, is
preferable to servitude amidst the greatest affluence;
and even the lowest condition in life, with freedom, is
better than the most exalted station without it. But
liberty in a state of society does not consist in doing
whatsoever we please; but only permits those actions
by which we do no injustice to our neighbour, or to
the community. The well-being of society requires the
efforts of all, from the highest to the lowest, to preserve
and support it; and since it appears to be the will of
Omnipotence, that mankind should live in this state of
social union (which does not admit of the unbridled
freedom of the savage state) a certain portion of individual
liberty must be given up for the good of the
whole; but the sacrifice should be bounded by the
common good: all beyond approaches towards slavery,
and degrades the people who submit to it.</p>

surpasses that of every living creature, insomuch that
as it darts along, the brilliancy and changeableness of
its colours, which cannot be described, appear like the
flash of a meteor. A Flying Fish being pursued by
a Dolphin, in his eagerness to escape, took too long
a flight, and his wings becoming dry, he fell upon a
rock, where his death was inevitable. The Dolphin,
in the keenness of his pursuit, ran himself on shore at
the foot of the rock, and was left by the wave, gasping
in the same condition as the other. Well, says the
Flying Fish, I must die it is certain; but it is some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
consolation to behold my merciless enemy involved in

The temper that is not touched with feelings
of this kind, must be of a highly philosophical cast indeed.

them through life. This Fable is a pretty image
of the vain fears and empty terrors, with which our
weak misguided nature is so apt to be alarmed and disturbed.
If we hear but ever so little noise which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
are not able to account for, immediately, nay, often
before we give ourselves time to consider about it, we
are struck with fear, and labour under a most unmanly
and unreasonable trepidation; more especially if the
alarm happens when we are alone, and in the dark.
These fears are ingrafted into our minds very early,
and therefore it is the more difficult, even when we are
grown up, and ashamed of them, to root them out of
our nature. They are chiefly the offspring of the nursery,
and originate in the many terrific tales, and lying
stories, of those who have the management there; and
though every pains be afterwards taken to free the
mind from the impression of such groundless fears,
the weaker part of mankind are still apt to be terrified
at the empty phantoms of ghosts, spectres, apparitions,
and hobgoblins. But whatever effect such
phantasies may have upon the guilty mind, innocence
has nothing to dread from supernatural causes. Fear
is however a natural passion, and its use is to put us
upon our guard against danger, by alarming the spirits;
but it, like all our other passions, should be kept
in a state of subjection: for though they are all good
and useful servants, yet if once they get the better of
our reason, they prove the most domineering tyrants
imaginable; nor do any of them treat us in so abject
and slavish a manner as fear: it unnerves and enfeebles
our limbs, while it fetters our understandings; and at
the same time that it represents a danger near at hand,
disarms and makes us incapable of defending ourselves
from it. But we ought to call forth a sense of honour
and shame, to correct such weaknesses; and for this
purpose it will be useful to remember the Fable of the
Lion and the Frog.</p>

itself in the upstart worthless placeman, who taking
advantage of his situation, which protects him, and
knowing that he is out of the reach of our resentment,
exhibits all the “insolence of office:” but such should
be put in mind, that a saucy deportment is no sign

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE COUNTRY AND THE CITY MOUSE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> plain Country Mouse was one day unexpectedly
visited at his hole, by a fine Mouse of the town, who
had formerly been his play-fellow. The honest rustic,
pleased with the honour, resolved to entertain his
friend as sumptuously as possible. He set before him a
reserve of delicate grey pease and bacon, a dish of fine
oatmeal, some parings of new cheese, and to crown all
with a dessert, a remnant of a charming mellow apple.
When the repast was nearly finished, the spark of the
town, taking breath, said, Old Crony, give me leave
to be a little free with you; how can you bear to live
in this melancholy hole here, with nothing but woods,
and meadows, and mountains, and rivulets about you?
Do you not prefer the conversation of the world to the
chirping of birds, and the splendour of the court, to
the rude aspect of a wild like this? With many flowery
arguments, he at last prevailed upon his country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
friend to accompany him to town, and about midnight
they safely entered a certain great house, where there
had been an entertainment the day before. Here it
was the courtier’s turn to entertain, and placing his
guest on a rich Persian carpet, they both began to
regale most deliciously, when on a sudden the noise
of somebody opening the door, made them scuttle in
confusion about the dining-room. The rustic in particular
was ready to die with fear at the many hair-breadth
escapes which followed. At last, recovering
himself, Well, says he, if this be your town-life, much
good may it do you. Give me my poor quiet hole
again, with my homely, but comfortable grey pease.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> moderate fortune, with a quiet retirement in the
country, is preferable to the greatest affluence, attended
with the care and the perplexity of business. How
often are we deceived by the specious shows of splendour
and magnificence; and what a poor exchange does
he make, who gives up ease and content in an humble
situation, to engage in difficulties, and encounter perils
in affluence and luxury! The ploughman in the field,
who labours for his daily pittance, earns his bread with
less uneasiness and fatigue, than the man who haunts
levees to obtain wealth and preferment. Riches, properly
used, are indeed very conducive to ease and happiness;
but if we leave any comfortable situation to
procure them, or abuse the possession of them by riot
and intemperance, we resign the end for the means,
mistake the shadow for the substance, and convert the
instruments of good fortune into the engines of anxiety
and solicitude.</p>

she kept her blind side towards the water, from whence
she had no apprehension of danger, and with the other

precaution, she thought herself in the utmost security;
but a sly fellow, with two poaching companions, who
had watched her several days to no purpose, at last took
a boat, and came gently down upon her, and shot her.
The Doe, in the agonies of death, breathed out this

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> are liable to many misfortunes that no care or

best way we can against them, and leave the rest to
Providence. The wisest of men have their foibles or
blind sides, and have their enemies too, who watch to
take advantage of their weaknesses. It behoves us
therefore to look to ourselves on the blind side, as the
part that lies most exposed to an attack. Vigilance
and caution are commonly our best preservatives from
evil, and security is often a fatal enemy, when we cherish
it so as to lull all our apprehensions to rest. We
should not however encourage in ourselves the slavish
principle of fear, nor make ourselves miserable on account
of latent evils, which it is not in our power to
prevent. The ways and workings of Providence are
inscrutable; and it is not in the power of human prudence
to obviate all the accidents of life.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Countryman being in want of a handle for his hatchet,
entered a wood and looked among the branches
for one that would suit his purpose. The Trees, with
a curiosity natural to some other creatures, asked him
what he was seeking? He replied that he only wanted
a piece of wood to make a handle to his axe, and
begged they would be so good as to permit him to
serve himself. Since that is all, said the Trees, help
yourself, and welcome. He immediately availed himself
of the permission, and had no sooner fitted up his
instrument, than he began pell-mell to cut and hack
about him, felling the noblest trees in all the forest,
without distinction. The Oak is said to have spoke
thus to the Beech, in a low whisper: Brother, we must
take all this for our easy credulity, and imprudent generosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">One</span> would imagine that the natural principle of self-preservation
implanted in us, would make it unnecessary
to caution any one not to furnish an enemy with
arms against himself. Yet daily experience shews us
that such instances of imprudence are not uncommon.
In this life we are liable to be surrounded with calamities
and distresses: we should therefore be cautious of
adding to our misfortunes, by our own want of caution,
and of putting power into the hands of those enemies,
which our merit or our affluence may tempt to rise up
against us. Any person in a community, by what
name or title soever distinguished, who affects a power
which may possibly hurt a people, is their enemy, and
therefore they ought not to trust him: for though he
were ever so fully determined not to abuse such a
power, yet he is so far a bad man, as he disturbs a
nation’s quiet, and makes them jealous and uneasy, by
desiring to have it, or even retaining it, when it may
prove mischievous. If we consult history, we shall
find that the thing called prerogative, has been claimed
and contended for chiefly by those who never intended
to make a good use of it; and as readily resigned by
wise and just princes, who had the true interest of their
people at heart. How like senseless stocks do they
act, who, by complimenting some capricious mortal,
from time to time, with scraps of prerogative, at last
put it out of their power to maintain their just and natural
liberty!</p>

of performing the same exploit, and darted down
upon a Ram; but instead of being able to carry it
up into the air, she found she had got her claws entangled
in its fleece, and could neither move herself
nor her fancied prize. Thus fixed, she was soon taken
by the Shepherd, and given away to some boys, who
eagerly enquired what bird it was? An hour ago, said
he, she fancied herself an Eagle; however I suppose
she is by this time convinced that she is but a Crow.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is impossible for any man to take a true measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
of the abilities of another, without an exact knowledge

which always exposes him to ridicule, and sometimes
to danger. Every man ought therefore to examine the
strength of his own mind with attention and impartiality,
and not fondly to flatter himself that he can by
an awkward and ill-judged emulation soar to the height
which has been attained by men endowed by nature
with great abilities and original talents, matured by
industry. We can no more adopt the genius of another
man, than we can assume his shape and person.
The bright original in every department of the arts
and sciences will be valued and esteemed, whilst his
puny imitators will be treated with neglect, or be despised.
Almost every man has something original in
himself, which, if duly cultivated, might perhaps procure
him respect and applause, and it is creditable for
him to endeavour justly to obtain them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE HORSE AND THE STAG.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> ancient times, when the Horse and the Deer
ranged the forest with uncontrolled freedom, it happened
that contentions arose between them about grazing
in particular meadows. These disputes ended in
a conflict between them, in which the Deer proved
victorious, and with his sharp horns drove the Horse
from the pasture. Full of disappointment and chagrin,
the Horse applied to the Man, and craved his
assistance, in order to re-establish him in the possession
of his rights. The request was granted, on condition
that he would suffer himself to be bridled, saddled,
and mounted by his new ally, with whose assistance he
entirely defeated his enemy; but the poor Horse was
mightily disappointed when, upon returning thanks to
the Man, and desiring to be dismissed, he received this
answer: No, I never knew before how useful a drudge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
you were; now I have found what you are good for,
you may be assured I will keep you to it.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Victories</span> may be purchased at too dear a rate, if
we solicit the assistance of allies capable of becoming
our most formidable enemies, and it will be vain to
flatter ourselves, that the yoke of slavery, if we once
willingly suffer it to be laid upon our shoulders, can be
easily shaken off, when the ends for which we bore it
are accomplished. The Fable is intended to caution
us against consenting to any thing that might prejudice
public liberty, as well as to keep us upon our guard in
the preservation of that which is of a private nature.
This is the use and interpretation given of it by Horace,
one of the best and most polite philosophers that
ever wrote. After reciting the Fable, he applies it
thus: This, says he, is the case of him, who, dreading
poverty, parts with that invaluable jewel, liberty;
like a wretch as he is, he will always be subject to a
tyrant of some sort or another, and be a slave for ever,
because his avaricious spirit knew not how to be contented
with that moderate competency, which he might
have possessed independent of all the world.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Miller and his Son were taking their Ass to market
to sell him, and that he might get thither in good condition,
they drove him gently before them. They had
not proceeded far before they met a company of travellers:
Sure, say they, you are mighty careful of your
Ass; one of you might as well get up and ride, as suffer
him to walk on at his ease, while you trudge after
on foot. In compliance with this advice, the Old Man
set his Son upon the beast. And now, they had scarcely
advanced a quarter of a mile further, before they met
another company. You idle young rogue, said one,
why dont you get down, and let your poor father ride?
Upon this, the Old Man made his Son dismount, and
got up himself. While they were marching in this
manner, a third company began to insult the father.
You hard-hearted wretch, say they, how can you suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
that poor lad to wade through the dirt, while you, like
an alderman, ride at your ease? The good-natured
Miller stood corrected, and immediately took his Son
up behind him. And now the next man they met exclaimed,
with more vehemence and indignation than all
the rest, Was there ever such a couple of lazy loobies!
to overload in so unconscionable a manner, a poor
dumb creature, who is far less able to carry you, than
you are to carry him! The complying Old Man
would have been half inclined to make the trial, had
not experience by this time sufficiently convinced him,
that there cannot be a more fruitless attempt, than to
endeavour to please all mankind.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is better to pursue the dictates of one’s own reason,
than attempt to please every body; for to do this
is next to impossible. Therefore we ought to decide

our mistakes from our own experience. Wise men are
instructed by reason; men of less understanding by experience;
the most ignorant by necessity; and beasts
by instinct. When a man so neglects himself, as not
to make a just use of his reason and his mental powers,
in combating with prejudice and folly, as well as the
caprice of others, he will ever be led on in a maze of
error, wavering and embarrassed about pursuing this
or that path, until between them he is lost in a labyrinth,
from which he will never be able to extricate
himself as long as he lives.</p>

when a Grasshopper in great distress, and in dread
of perishing with cold and hunger, approached their
avenues, and with great humility begged they would
relieve his wants, and permit him to take shelter in any
corner of their comfortable mansion. One of the Ants
asked him how he had disposed of his time in summer,
that he had not taken pains and laid in a stock, as they
had done? Alas! my friends, says he, I passed away
the time merrily and pleasantly, in drinking, singing,
and dancing, and never once thought of winter. If
that be the case, replied the Ant, all I have to say is
this: that they who drink, sing, and dance in the summer,
run a great risk of starving in the winter.</p>

so youth and manhood are the times of life which
we should employ in laying in such a stock as may

we call rational creatures, who squander away in a
profuse prodigality, whatever they get in their younger
days, as if the infirmity of age would require no supplies
to support it, or at least would find them administered
to it in some miraculous way. From this Fable
we learn this admirable lesson, never to lose the
present opportunity of fairly and honestly providing
against the future evils and accidents of life; and while
health and the vigour of our faculties remain firm and
entire, to lay them out to the best advantage; so that
when age and infirmities despoil us of our strength and
abilities, we may not have to bewail that we have neglected
to provide for the wants of our latter days: for it
should always be remembered, that “a youth of revels
breeds an age of care,” and that temperance in youth
lays the foundation of health and comfort for old age.</p>

to which the beasts were liable. These professions
having been spread abroad, he hoped to get many of
the animals to come within his clutches. The Horse
seeing through the whole of the scheme, was resolved
to be even with him; and so humouring the thing as if
he suspected nothing, he feigned himself to be in great
pain from a wound in his foot, and limping up to the
Lion, he begged he would examine the part and administer
relief. The Lion, though intent only upon making
a good meal of horse-flesh, begged the Horse to hold up
his foot that he might see it: this was no sooner done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
than the Horse gave him so violent a blow on the nose,
as quite stunned him, and scampered off, neighing at
the success of a trick, which had defeated the purpose
of one who intended to have tricked him out of his life.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">We</span> ought never to put trust in the fair words and
pretensions of those who have both an interest and inclination

intended against us, it is not in the nature of things to
expect that we should not, if we can, turn the tables
upon the plotters. Treachery has something so wicked
and worthy of punishment in its nature, that it deserves
to meet with a return of its own kind. An open
revenge is too liberal for it, and nothing matches it
but itself. Though a man of sense and honour will
always view tricking and fraud of all kinds as mean
and beneath him, and will despise setting such an example,
yet it cannot be inconsistent with virtue to counteract
the schemes of those who are taking all manner
of undue advantages, and hatching wicked plots to undermine

Nay, I prithee friend, replies the Fox, if

anguish of a delicate mind, by empty professions and
unmeaning compassion. For, to stand bemoaning the

Generous men should therefore use a just circumspection
in the choice of the objects of their benevolence,

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE DEER AND THE LION.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Deer, terrified by the cry of the Hunters, instead
of trusting to his fleetness, made towards a cave which
he chanced to espy, and in which he hoped to conceal
himself until they were passed by; but he had scarcely
reached the entrance before he was seized by a Lion
who lay crouching there, ready to spring upon his
prey, and who instantly killed and tore him to pieces.
In the last agonies of death, he thus gave vent to his
feelings: Ah, me! said he, unhappy creature that I
am. I hoped in this cave to escape the pursuit of
men; but have fallen into the jaws of the most cruel
and rapacious of wild beasts.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable points out the dangers to which we expose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
ourselves, when, for want of presence of mind,
we suffer ourselves to be guided by our unreasoning
fears, which no sooner shew us an evil, than they
throw us into the utmost confusion in our manner of
escaping, and prevent us from discerning the safe path
by which we ought to avoid it. Thus, in a rash endeavour
to shun a less danger, we oftentimes blindly
run headlong into a greater. The fate of the Deer
should warn us to consider well what may be the ultimate
consequences, before we take any important step;
for many paths which appear smooth and pleasant at a
distance, are found to be rough and dangerous, when
we come to tread them; and many a plausible scheme,
which promises us ease and safety, is no better than a
tempting bower, with a Lion crouching among its foliage,
ready to spring upon and devour us.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">As</span> a Ploughman was turning up the soil, his plough
uncovered a treasure which had been hidden there.
Transported with joy, he seized upon it, and fervently
began to thank the ground for being so liberal to him.
Fortune passing by, observed what he was about, and
could not forbear shewing her resentment at it. You
stupid creature, said she, to lie thus thanking the
ground, and take no notice of me! If you had lost
such a treasure, instead of finding one, I should have
been the first you would have laid the blame upon.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">How</span> often do we ascribe our success or misfortunes
to wrong causes! Vanity sometimes leads us to consider
our prosperity as the natural result of our own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
sagacity, and inattention sometimes induces us to make
acknowledgments to wrong persons. But if we would
have our praises valued, we should be cautious to direct
them properly. Our thanks are an indirect affront to
those who receive them without deserving them; and
at the same time an act of open ingratitude to those
who merit them without receiving them. In prosperity,
as well as in adversity, let us not forget the power
and goodness of Heaven; and if we implore the aid of
the Almighty in our distress, we should not neglect to
send up our acknowledgments of his goodness with the
voice of gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> Ape meeting with a Fox, humbly requested he
would be so good as to give him some of the superfluous
hair from his bushy tail, to make into a covering
for his bare posteriors, which were exposed to all the
inclemency of the weather; and he endeavoured to further
his suit by observing to Reynard, that he had far
more than he had any occasion for, and a great part
even dragged along in the dirt. The Fox answered,
that as to his having too much, it was more than he
knew; but be it as it would, he had rather sweep the
ground with his tail as long as he lived, than part with
the least bit of it for a covering to the filthy posteriors
of an Ape.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Riches,</span> in the hands of a wise and generous man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
are a blessing to the community in which he lives:
they are like the light and the rain, and diffuse a good
all around them. But wealth, when it falls to the lot
of those who want benevolence and humanity, serves
only as an instrument of mischief, or at best produces
no advantage to the rest of mankind. The good man
considers himself as a kind of steward to those from
whom fortune has withheld her smiles, and thus shews
his gratitude to Heaven for the abundance which has
been showered down upon him. He directs the superfluous
part of his wealth at least, to the necessities of
such of his fellow-creatures as are worthy of it, and
this he would do from feeling, though there were no
religion which enjoined it. But selfish avaricious persons,
who are generally knaves, how much soever they
may have, will never think they have enough, much
less be induced, by any consideration of virtue or religion,
to part with any portion for the purposes of
charity and beneficence. If the riches and power of
the world were to be always in the hands of the virtuous
part of mankind, it would seem, according to our
human conceptions, that they would produce more good
than in those of the vile and grovelling mortals, who
often possess them. Without any merit, these move
apparently in a sphere of ease and splendour, while
good sense and honesty have to struggle in adversity,
or walk in the dirt. But the all-wise Disposer of
Events does certainly permit this order of things for
just, good, and wise purposes, though our shallow understandings
are not able to fathom them.</p>

Thief, eager for a prize, stripped off his cloaths, and
went down to the bottom to search for it; where having
groped about to no purpose, he came up again,

their wickedness upon their own heads. In these instances,
Justice seems as it were to be acting in person,
and saves the trouble of publicly enforcing punishment
by the penal laws; but indeed vice carries with
it its own punishment, and the misery attendant upon
it in this world, seems always pretty exactly balanced
to its various degrees of enormity. The abandoned
man drags on a contemptible or infamous life, with a
constantly deadened or disturbed conscience, and amidst
associates like himself, where he can never hope
to meet with either friendship or fidelity.</p>

Upon this they generally went; but it was particularly
taken notice of, that the Fox was not one of the

Jackalls to enquire why he had so little charity and
respect as never to come near him, at a time when he
lay so dangerously ill, and every body else had been
to see him? Why, replies the Fox, pray present my
duty to his majesty, and tell him that I have the same
respect for him as ever, and have been coming several
times, but was fearful of being troublesome, as I have
observed, from the prints of their footsteps, that great
numbers have gone into the royal den; but I have not
seen a single trace of their coming out again.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">He</span> that embarks implicitly in any scheme, may be
mistaken, notwithstanding the number who keep him
company; but he that keeps out till he sees reason to
enter, acts upon true maxims of policy; and it is the
quintessence of prudence not to be too easy of belief:
for a rash and hasty credulity has been the ruin of
many. Men who habituate themselves to think, will
profit by the experience of others, as well as their own:
but commonly the multitude do not reason, but stupidly
follow each other step by step; not moving out
of the sphere in which chance has placed them: and
the notions or prejudices they may have imbibed in
youth, remain with them to the last. There is no
opinion, however impious or absurd, that has not its
advocates in some quarter of the world. Whoever,
therefore, takes up his creed upon trust, and grounds
his principles on no better reason than his being a native
or inhabitant of the regions wherein they prevail,
becomes a disciple of Mahomet in Turkey, and of
Confucius in China; a Jew, or a Pagan, as the accident
of birth decides.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> dispute arose between the North Wind and the
Sun, about the superiority of their power, and they
agreed to determine matters by trying which of them
could first compel a Traveller to throw off his cloak.
The North Wind began, and blew a very cold blast,
accompanied by a sharp driving shower; but this, and
whatever else he could do, instead of making the Man
quit his cloak, induced him to gird it about him more
closely. Next came the Sun, who, breaking out from
a cloud, drove away the cold vapours, and darted his
warm sultry beams upon the weather-beaten Traveller.
The Man growing faint with the heat, first threw off
his heavy cloak, and then flew for protection to the
shade of a neighbouring grove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">There</span> is something in the temper of man so averse
to severe and boisterous treatment, that he who endeavours
to carry his point in that way, instead of prevailing,
generally leaves the mind of him whom he has
thus attempted to subdue, in a more confirmed and
obstinate state. Bitter words and hard usage freeze
the heart into an obduracy, which mild, persuasive,
and gentle language only can dissolve. Persecution
has always fixed those opinions which it was intended
to dispel; and the quick growth of christianity in early
times, is attributed in a great measure to the barbarous
reception which its first teachers met with in the Pagan
world; and since that time the different modes of
faith which have grown out of christianity itself, have
been each established by the same kind of intolerant
spirit. To reflect upon these things, furnishes matter
of wonder and regret, for the benevolent Author of the
christian religion taught neither intolerance nor persecution.
The doctrines he laid down are plain, pure,
and simple. They teach mercy to the contrite, aid to
the humble, and eternal happiness to the good. In
short, persecution is the scandal of all religion, and
like the north wind in the Fable, only tends to make
a man wrap his notions more closely about him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Horse, adorned with his great war-saddle, and
champing his foaming bridle, came thundering along
the high-way, and made the mountains echo with his
neighing. He had not gone far before he overtook
an Ass, who was labouring under a heavy burthen,
and moving slowly on in the same track. In an imperious
tone he threatened to trample him in the dirt,
if he did not get out of the way. The poor Ass, not
daring to dispute, quietly got aside as fast as he could,
and let him go by. Not long after this, the same
Horse, in an engagement, happened to be shot in the
eye, which made him unfit for show, or any military
business, so he was stripped of his ornaments, and sold
to a carrier. The Ass meeting him in this forlorn
condition, thought that now it was his time to retort:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
Hey-day, friend, says he, is it you! Well, I always
believed that pride of your’s would one day have a fall.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is an affectation of appearing considerable, that
puts men upon being proud and insolent; but this very
affectation infallibly makes them appear little and despicable
in the eyes of discerning people. Did the
proud man but rightly consider what kind of ingredients
pride is composed of and fed with, and the
unstable foundation, and the tottering pinnacle upon
which it stands, he would blush at the thoughts of it,
and cease to be puffed up by the little supernumerary
advantages, whether of birth, fortune, or title, which
he may enjoy above his neighbours. These might indeed
be a blessing to him, and to the community in
which he lives, if wisely used; but if guided by pride,
and consequently by want of sense, they will prove
only a curse; and the reverence and respect which he
looks for, will not be paid with sincerity, nor does he
deserve it; and should the tide of misfortune set in
against him, instead of friendship and commiseration,
he will meet with nothing but contempt, and that with
much more justice than ever he himself expressed it towards
others. The vain proud man ought to be put in
mind, that the time is not far distant, when his skull
will not be distinguished from that of the beggar; and
that there is no state, however exalted, so permanent,
that it may not be reduced to a level with the lowest.</p>

Pigeon, flew with such violence against the corner of a

and instantly ran and picked up the Hawk, and
was going to kill him; but the latter begged the Man
would let him go, assuring him he was only following
a Pigeon, and neither intending, nor had done, any
harm to him. To which the Farmer replied, and
what harm had the Pigeon done to you? and wrung
his head off immediately.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> all our transactions through life, to suppose

about the rectitude of our behaviour: for this
we may be assured of, that we are acting wrong, whenever
we are doing any thing to another, which we
should think unjust, if it were done to us. Let those,
therefore, who intend to act justly, but take this view

up came the Hunters, and enquired of the Man it he
had seen the Fox, and which way he had taken? No,
said he, I have not seen him here, he has passed another
way; but all the while he nodded with his head,
and pointed with his finger to the place where the Fox
was hidden. These signals the Hunters, in the eagerness
of pursuit, did not notice, but calling off the dogs,
they dashed along in another direction. Soon after,
the Fox came out of his hiding-place, and was sneaking
off; when the Man calling after him,—Hollo, says
he, is this the way you behave then, to go without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>

however incapable of it, to have returned you suitable

<p><span class="firstword">Dissimulation</span> and double dealing are among the
most odious vices, and a hollow friend is worse than

we are led to depend upon the man who uses

underhand we are giving intelligence to his enemies,
is treacherous, knavish, and base. Truth is a plain
and open virtue, and cannot be practised in part; and

himself with a company of little Boys at their childish
diversions, and began to jeer and laugh at him
for it. Æsop, who was too much a wag himself to
suffer others to ridicule him, took a bow unstrung,
and laid it upon the ground. Then calling the censorious
Athenian, Now philosopher, says he, expound
the riddle if you can, and tell us what the unstrained
bow implies. The Man, after racking his brains a
considerable time to no purpose, at last gave it up,
and declared he knew not what to make of it. Why,
says Æsop, smiling, if you keep a bow always bent,
it will lose its elasticity presently; but if you let it go
slack, it will be fitter for use when you want it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> mind of man is not formed for unremitted attention,
nor his body for uninterrupted labour; and
both are in this respect like a bow. We cannot go
through any business requiring intense thought, without
unbending the mind, any more than we can perform
a long journey without refreshing ourselves by
due rest at the several stages of it. Continual labour,
as in the case of the bended bow, destroys the elasticity
and energy of both body and mind. It is, therefore,
absolutely necessary for the studious man to unbend,
and the laborious one to take his rest, or both
lose their tone and vigour, and become dull and languid.
It is to remedy these extremes, that pastimes
and diversions ought to be kept up, provided they are
innocent. The heart that never tastes of pleasure,
shuts up, grows stiff, and is at last incapable of enjoyment.</p>

went and paid the Wolf a visit. The latter excused
himself from seeing the Fox, by pretending he was

matters stood, took his leave, and immediately went
to a Shepherd to inform him of the discovery he had
made, and that he had nothing else to do but to take
a good weapon with him, and with it easily dispatch
the Wolf as he lay dosing in his cave. The Shepherd
following his directions, presently went and killed the

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> villain, whose only aim is to get what he can,
will as soon betray the innocent as the guilty. Let

of bringing other villains to punishment, yet
they will at last suffer in their turn; for, after being
detested by all good men, justice will, sooner or later,
overtake their crimes, and hurl down its vengeance on
their heads, with a measure equal at least to the sufferings

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Bee, whose business had led her to the brink of
a purling stream, was snatched away by its circling
eddy, and carried down its current. A Dove, pitying
her distressed situation, cropped a twig from a tree,
and dropt it before her in the water, by means of
which the Bee saved herself, and got ashore. Not
long after, a Fowler having a design upon the Dove,
espied her sitting on a tree, and keeping out of her

This the Bee perceiving, stung him on the ear, which
made him give so sudden a start, that the Dove instantly
took the alarm, and flew away.</p>

to relieve a sinking friend from distress and danger, or
endeavour to forewarn him against the wicked plots of

motives, will always be disposed to do good
offices to all, and the grateful man will never forget to
return them in kind, if it be possible; and there is not
one good man in the world who may not on some occasion
stand in need of the help of another. But gratitude
is not very common among mankind. It is a
heavenly spark, from which many virtues spring; and
the source of pleasures which never enter the breast of
the vile ingrate. The favours and kindnesses bestowed
upon the grateful man, he cannot forget; those which
are conferred upon the ungrateful, are lost: he concludes
he would not have had them, if he had not deserved
them.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Child was playing in a meadow, and by chance
trod upon a Serpent. The Serpent, in the fury of his
passion, turned up and bit the Child with his venomous
teeth, so that he died immediately. The Father
of the Child, inspired with grief and revenge, took a
weapon, and pursuing the Serpent, before he could
get into his hole, struck at him and lopped off a piece
of his tail. The next day, hoping by stratagem to
finish his revenge, he brought to the Serpent’s hole
honey, and meal, and salt, and desired him to come
forth, protesting that he only sought a reconciliation
on both sides; but the Serpent answered him with a
hiss to this purpose: In vain you attempt a reconciliation;
for as long as the memory of the dead Child and
the mangled tail subsists, it will be impossible for you
and I to have any charity for each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> persons have carried their differences to an
extreme length, it is in vain for them to think of renewing
a cordial friendship; for in the heat of their
quarrel, many injuries must have been reciprocally
offered and received, which must tear asunder the
strongest bands of amity. The fury of their dissentions
may indeed subside, yet neither party can forgive
the wrongs which neither can forget. The consciousness
of having provoked the resentment of another,
will dwell so continually upon the mind of the aggressor,
that he cannot rest till he has finished his work,
and put it as much as possible out of his enemy’s power
to make any return upon him; and the old proverb
will be verified which says, “The man who has injured
you, will never forgive you.” Morality bids us
forgive our enemies, and the voice of reason confirms
the same; but neither reason nor morality bids us enter
into a friendship with, or repose a confidence in,
those who have injured us, and of whom we have a
bad opinion. We may resolve not to return ill-usage;
but ought never to put ourselves into the power of an
enemy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE HORSE AND THE OVER-LOADED ASS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> clownish stupid Fellow, in travelling to market
with his goods, loaded his Horse very lightly, and put
a heavy burden upon his Ass, and was trudging along
the road with them on foot. They had not travelled
half-way to their journey’s end, when the Ass felt greatly
overpowered with the weight he carried, and begged
the Horse would be so good as to assist him by taking
a part of it upon his back, and lighten the grievous
burden, assuring him that through weakness he was
quite exhausted, and was ready to faint. No! said
the Horse, keep your burden to yourself, it does not
concern me. Upon hearing this cruel reply, the poor
Ass dropped down, and soon expired. The Master
then ungirded the pack-saddle, and awkwardly tried
several ways to relieve his Ass, but all to no purpose;
it was too late. When he perceived how matters stood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
he took the whole burden and laid it upon the Horse,
together with the skin of the dead Ass, and when he
felt tired with walking, he also mounted himself. The
Horse is said to have often muttered as he went along,
Well, this is my proper punishment, for refusing to
help my fellow-servant in the depth of his distress.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">He</span> who has no compassion in his breast, is unworthy
the title of a man; and the heart that feels no
anguish at the misfortunes of others, nor a desire to
relieve those who groan under a load of sorrow, is
destitute of the very grounds and principles of virtue.
The eye that has no tear for the griefs of a friend, is
also blind to its own interest; for the burden of human
affairs must be borne by some or other of us, and
the duty, as well as the common necessity of helping
one another, ought not to be shuffled off by the unworthy
expression of “it is none of my business:” for
the business of society is more or less the business of
every man who lives in it; and he who permits his
weak brother, for want of timely assistance, to sink
under a greater weight than he is able to sustain, deserves
to be punished for his cruelty, by being obliged
to bear the whole of his own distressing burdens himself.
The Fable also hints at the miseries which
poor dumb useful animals undergo, from the injudicious
management or cruel treatment of those under
whose government they have the misfortune to fall.
These kind of “hogs in armour” ought to be taught
by their own sufferings, the benevolent text, that “A
merciful man will be merciful to his beast.”</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> we become so abandoned to stupidity and a

however little we may be criminal in reality, we must
expect the same censure and punishment as is due to
the most notorious of our companions. The world

from his associates: nor is this rule founded on wrong
principles; for, generally speaking, those who are constant
companions, are either drawn together by a similitude
of manners and principles, or form such a
similitude by daily commerce and conversation. If,
therefore, we are tender of our reputation, we should
be particularly delicate in the choice of our company,
since some portion of their fame or infamy must unavoidably
be reflected upon us. It is not enough to be
virtuous ourselves, but we must be cautious not to
associate with those who are devoted to vice: for,
though we cannot confer any degree of our own credit
upon them, we may suffer much discredit, and incur
much danger, from mixing with such bad companions.</p>

kept out of sight. The other falling flat upon his face,

When all was over, the Spark who had climbed the

our burdens, in passing through it, or contribute more

with fair words, pretend to that character, and are
ever ready to offer their services when there is no occasion

from the furnace, shines forth in his true lustre, and
with heart and hand is ever ready to succour us, in
times of tribulation and peril. It is on such only we
ought to place a confidence in any undertaking of importance;
for the man who is wholly actuated by the
selfish unsocial principle of caring only for himself, is
not fit to be associated with others of a more generous
character; and he who will desert them in adversity
ought not to be made a partaker of the prosperity of
others. It therefore behoves us diligently to examine
into the fidelity of those we have to deal with, before

clapped his wings, crowing and proclaiming his victory.
An Eagle, who was watching for his prey, saw him

The vanquished Cock perceiving this, quitted the place

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable shews us the impropriety and inconvenience
of running into extremes, and teaches us, that
under all the various and sudden vicissitudes of human
life, we ought to bear success with moderation, and misfortune
with fortitude and equinamity; to repress immoderate
exultation, and unmanly despair. Much of our
happiness depends upon keeping an even balance in
our words and actions, and in not suffering circumstances
to mount us too high in time of prosperity, nor
to sink us too low with the weight of adverse fortune. A
wise man will not place too high a value on blessings
which he knows to be no more than temporary; nor
will he repine at evils, whose duration may perhaps be
but short, and cannot be eternal. He will submit himself
with humility and resignation to the decrees of
providence, and the will of heaven. In prosperity, the
fear of evil will check the insolence of triumph; and in
adversity, the hope of good will sustain his spirit, and
teach him to endure his misfortunes with constancy
and fortitude.</p>

the Owner of the corn, with his servants, coming upon

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> the enemy comes to make a seizure, they

hangs like a dead weight about a man; and we
never feel gold so heavy as when we are endeavouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
to make off with it. Great wealth has many cares
annexed to it, with which the poor and needy are not
afflicted. A competency to supply the necessities of
nature, and the wants of old age, is indeed to be desired;
but we should rather endeavour to contract our
wants, than to multiply them, and not too eagerly
grasp at the augmentation of our possessions, which
will increase our cares by adding to our danger. Persons
of small fortune have as much reason to be contented
as the rich: their situation is full as happy, considered
altogether, for if they are deprived of some of
the gratifications which the rich enjoy, they are also
exempted from many troubles and uneasinesses necessarily
cleaving to riches.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Frogs and the Mice, who inhabited part of a

sufficient room to hold many whole nations of

peace: many bitter disputes arose between them about
the right to particular pools, and their tuft-covered
margins. At length, national jealousies and animosities
arose to such a height, that each claimed the
sovereignty of the whole fen, and the most rancorous
war was waged between them, in order to settle, by
force of arms, their respective pretensions. While their
hostile armies were drawn up in battle array, on a
plain of several square yards in extent, protected on
both flanks and rear by dark pools and gloomy forests
of sedges, reeds, and bulrushes, their two chieftains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
advanced to meet each other, and to it they fell as
fierce as tigers. While these two combatants were thus
engaged, a Kite sailing in the air, beheld them from a
great distance, and darting down upon them, instantly
bore them off in his talons; while the field of battle
presented a delicious repast to some Ravens, who had
chanced to spy the movements of these hostile armies.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> leading feature in the character of men, in all
ages of the world, has ever been self-interest; and
when this is not kept within due bounds, by a just sense
of morality and honour, their bad passions are let
loose, and money, power, or dominion, are the chief
objects they keep in view. When men thus depraved,
have long soared above restraint, and their numbers
and power become predominant in a nation, the accumulation
of their wickedness hurries them blindly
on to break out into offensive wars with other nations,
on the most frivolous pretences, and rapine, plunder,
and innumerable murders succeed, by which humanity
is outraged, and the fair face of nature is
deluged with blood. “Peace is the natural happy
state of man, and war is his disgrace.” The mighty
among the Frogs and Mice attend not to this: they
strut and exult for a time; but their pride, tyranny, and
injustice, will have an end: for opposed to these vices
are the attributes of Omnipotence, and they are eternal.
It often happens (as in the case of the combatants in
the Fable) that when national depravity has attained
its height, the Kites and Ravens of other regions are
invited forth, and made the instruments of a just
retribution.</p>

<p class="in0">And that people of a low turn of spirit and mean education,
cannot change their principles by changing their
situation: for in the midst of splendour and magnificence,
they still retain the same narrow sentiments,
and seldom fail to betray, by some dirty action, their
original baseness, which no embroidery can conceal;
and though fortune has been pleased to lift them out
of the mire, we still see the silly awkward blockheads
displaying their lack of mind and education through
all their ensigns of dignity. If any thing more need
be added, it can only be with a view of more plainly
putting inexperienced youth on their guard against
making inconsiderate connections, lest they take a
Cat into their bosom, instead of an amiable consort
and companion for life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE FOWLER AND THE PARTRIDGE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Fowler having taken a Partridge in his nets, the
bird begged hard for a reprieve, and promised the
man, if he would let him go, to decoy the other Partridges
into his snares. No, replies the Fowler, if I had
before been undetermined what to do with you, now
you have condemned yourself by your own words: for
he who is such a scoundrel as to offer to betray his
friends, to save himself, deserves if possible worse than
death.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">To</span> betray our friends is one of the blackest of
crimes; and however much traitors may suppose they
recommend themselves by their successful acts of treachery,
they will find that those who employ them as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
useful instruments in any dirty business of faction or
party, are shocked at the baseness of their minds; and
however convenient it may be to “like the treason,
the traitor will be despised.” History furnishes us with
many instances of kings and great men who have punished
the actors of treachery with death, though the
part they acted had been so conducive to their interests
as to give them a victory, or perhaps the quiet possession
of a throne: nor can princes pursue a more just
maxim than this, for a traitor is a villain, and sticks
at nothing to promote his own selfish ends. He that
will betray one master for a bribe, will betray another
on the same account. It is therefore impolitic in any
state to suffer such wretches to live under its protection.
Since then this maxim is so good, and likely at
all times to be acted upon, what stupid rogues must
they be who undertake such precarious dirty work!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE BLIND MAN AND THE LAME.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> blind Man and a lame Man happening to come
at the same time to a piece of very bad road, the former
begged of the latter that he would be so kind as
to guide him through the difficulty. How can I do
that, said the lame Man, since I am scarcely able to
drag myself along? But as you appear to be very
strong, if you will carry me, we will seek our fortunes
together. It will then be my interest to warn you
against any thing that may obstruct your way; your
feet shall be my feet, and my eyes your’s. With all
my heart, replied the blind Man; let us mutually serve
each other. So, taking his lame companion on his
back, they by means of this union travelled on with
safety and pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">There</span> is no such thing as absolute independence,
in a state of society, and the defects and weaknesses of
individuals form the cement by which it is bound together.
All men have their imperfections and wants,
and must help each other as a matter of expediency as
well as virtue; for Providence has so ordered things in
this life, that like the blind man and the lame in the
Fable, we may be serviceable to each other in almost
every instance. What one man wants another supplies.
Without these failings there would be neither
friendship nor company; so that it is our interest to
be both charitable and sociable, when our very wants
and necessities are converted by Providence into blessings.
The whole race of mankind ought indeed to be
but so many members of the same body; and in contributing
to the ease and convenience of each other,
we are not only serviceable to the whole, but kind to
ourselves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE LION, THE WOLF, AND THE DOG.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Lion having seized upon a Doe, while he was
standing over his prize, a Wolf stepped up to him, and
impudently claimed to go halves. No! said the Lion,
you are too apt to take what is not your due. I therefore
shall never have any thing to do with you, and I
peremptorily insist on your immediate departure out
of my sight. A poor honest Dog, who happened to
be passing, and heard what was going on, modestly
withdrew, intending to go about another way. Upon
which the Lion kindly invited him to come forward
and partake with him of the feast, to which his modesty
had given him so good a title.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">There</span> is something in modesty which ought ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
strongly to prepossess us in favour of those persons
in whose nature it is interwoven; and men of discerning
and generous minds have a pleasure in discovering
it, and in bringing into notice the worthy man, who is
diffident of his merit, and cannot prevail upon himself
to challenge the praise or tribute he deserves. It is,
however, to be lamented, that such patrons are not
very numerous, and that the assuming arrogance and
teasing importunities of the greedy forward man should
so commonly succeed in attaining his ends, while
modesty in silence starves unnoticed, and is for ever
poor. Were men in exalted stations of life to pay
more attention to the importance of this, and endeavour
to discover modest worth, to draw merit from the
shade, and virtue from obscurity, and distribute their
patronage and their favours to such only, their own
affairs, as well as those of the public, would be better
managed, and the difference between the conduct of
upstart pride and sensible plain honesty would soon
shew itself in its true unvarnished colours.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE ASS EATING THISTLES.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> Ass was loaded with provisions of several sorts,
which he was carrying home for a grand entertainment.
By the way, he met with a fine large Thistle,
and being very hungry, immediately eat it up, which,
while he was doing, he entered into this reflection:
How many greedy epicures would think themselves
happy amidst such a variety of delicate viands as I now
carry! But to me, this bitter prickly Thistle is more
savory and relishing than the most exquisite and sumptuous
banquet.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Temperance</span> and exercise may be regarded as the
constituents of natural luxury. It is not in the power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
of the whole art of cookery, to give such an exquisite
relish and seasoning to a dish, as these two will confer
on the plainest fare. Indolent epicures have no true
taste: they subsist entirely by whets and provocatives
of appetite; but he whose stomach is braced and
strengthened by exercise, has a whet within himself,
which adds a poignancy to every morsel that he eats.
Providence seems to have carved out its blessings with
an equal hand, and what it has denied to the poor in
one way, it has amply supplied them with in another:
if it have withheld riches, it has given them a greater
store of health; and if it have refused them the means
of luxury, it has at least formed them with the capacity
of living as happily without it. And it may further
be observed, that if we except hereditary diseases,
almost every other ailment may be laid to the account
of indolence, intemperance, or anxiety of mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE DOG AND THE CAT.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Never</span> were two creatures happier together than a
Dog and a Cat, reared in the same house from the
time of their birth. They were so kind, so gamesome,
and diverting, that it was half the entertainment of the
family to see the gambols and love tricks that passed
between them. Still it was observed, that at mealtimes,
when scraps fell from the table, or a tit-bit was
thrown to them, they would be snarling and spitting
at one another like the bitterest foes.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable is too true a picture of the practices
and friendships of the world. We first enter into
agreeable conversations, contract likings, and form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
close intimacies and connections, which one would
think nothing could ever break up; but clashing interests
at length come in the way, and dissolve the
charm. An unreasonable desire to engross more than
we can enjoy, is the bone of contention, which in
greater or less degrees sets mankind together by the
ears. A jealous thought, a mistaken word or look,
is then sufficient to cancel all former bonds: the league
is broken, and the farce concludes like the Dog and
the Cat in the Fable, with biting and scratching out
one another’s eyes. The same kind of over-grasping
selfishness which operates so powerfully upon and
blinds individuals, may with equal truth be charged
against all public associations or societies of men, from
the greatest to the least, when they are under the influence
of that mistaken patriotism, which, instead of
applying its powers to the improvement of what they
already possess, seeks aggrandizement by engrossing
the colonies or privileges of their less powerful neighbours.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE TRUMPETER TAKEN PRISONER.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> Trumpeter, being taken prisoner in battle, begged
hard for quarter, declaring his innocence, and
protesting, that he neither had killed nor could kill any
man, bearing no arms but his trumpet, which he was
obliged to sound at the word of command. For that
reason, replied his enemies, we are determined not to
spare you; for though you yourself never fight, yet,
with that wicked instrument of yours, you blow up
animosity among other people, and so become the
cause of much bloodshed.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> fomenter of mischief is at least as culpable as
he who puts it in execution. A man may be guilty of
murder, who never has handled a sword or pulled a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
trigger, or lifted up his arm with any mischievous weapon.
There is a little incendiary called the tongue,
which is more venomous than a poisoned arrow, and
more killing than a two-edged sword. The moral of
the Fable therefore is this, that if in any civil insurrection,
the persons taken in arms against the government
deserve to die, much more do they whose devilish
tongues or pens gave birth to the sedition, and
excited the tumult. The Fable is also equally applicable
to those evil counsellors, who excite corrupt or
wicked governments to sap and undermine, and then
to overturn the just laws and liberties of a whole people;
or involve them in cruel offensive wars, in which
they cause thousands upon thousands of swords to be
drawn, and whole armies of men to be cut in pieces,
while they themselves coolly sit out of danger, and
calculate the gains they derive from the wide-spreading
desolation. War is the most horrid custom that ever
resulted from human wickedness, and is caused only
by the ignorance of the people, or the wickedness of
governments.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2">THE BOYS AND THE FROGS.</h2>

<p><span class="firstword">A</span> company of idle Boys used to assemble on the
margin of a lake, inhabited by a great number of
Frogs, and divert themselves by throwing vollies of
stones into the water, to the great annoyance and danger
of the poor terrified Frogs, who were thus pelted
to death as soon as any of them put up their heads.
At length, one of the boldest of the Frogs ventured,
in behalf of the whole community, to croak out their
complaints. Ah, my Boys, said he, why will you
learn so soon the cruel practices of your race? Consider,
I beseech you, that though this may be sport
to you, it is death to us!</p>

<h3>APPLICATION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> Fable shews the propensity of unguided youth
to do evil, and points out the need of inculcating benignity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
of conduct upon their minds, and giving them
a direction towards a manly and generous humanity,
which in manhood will shew itself in actions and habits
that cannot fail to do honour to themselves, and
qualify them for any office in the service of their country.
The contrary of all this will be found to predominate
in society, when youth are suffered to go on
with impunity, in indulging their wicked inclinations
for cruelty, by which their minds are hardened and
debased. This hard-heartedness in boys will grow into
brutality and tyranny in man; and that cruelty
which was at first inflicted upon poor dumb animals,
will soon shew itself upon their fellows. The great
man of this cast will tyrannize over those below him:
these again will shew the same hateful disposition to
their dependants, and so downwards to the lowest,
who, guided only by ignorance, will give vent to their
natural baseness, by goading and distressing the poor
animals which are wretchedly toiling in their service.</p>
